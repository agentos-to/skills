# Skills — orientation for Claude

You are inside `~/dev/agentos/skills/`, the Python skills repo.
Every skill is an adapter from an external service to a small,
uniform set of shapes + capabilities the engine routes on.

**Before you touch a skill — build, extend, or debug — read the
canonical docs below. Do not guess.** The golden rule of this
repo is: *there is always an existing pattern. Copy it, don't
invent.*

## Read first (the cheat sheet)

| Task | Read | Canonical example |
|---|---|---|
| Building any skill | [`skills/overview.md`](../docs/src/content/docs/skills/overview.md) | — |
| Adding login / auth | [`skills/adding-login.md`](../docs/src/content/docs/skills/adding-login.md) | ABP, Exa, Goodreads |
| Auth internals (cookies, tokens, providers) | [`skills/auth-flows.md`](../docs/src/content/docs/skills/auth-flows.md) | — |
| Credential matchmaking (how `login` gets `{email,password}`) | [`skills/adding-login.md#the-three-credential-resolution-paths`](../docs/src/content/docs/skills/adding-login.md) | `abp.py::login` |
| Multi-step flows (OTP / SMS / OAuth consent) | [`skills/auth-flows.md#multi-step-flows`](../docs/src/content/docs/skills/auth-flows.md) | `exa.py::send_login_code` / `verify_login_code` |
| Reverse engineering an API | [`skills/reverse-engineering/`](../docs/src/content/docs/skills/reverse-engineering/) | `united/requirements.md` for endpoint inventory style |
| Connections, auth types, `@connection` | [`skills/connections.md`](../docs/src/content/docs/skills/connections.md) | — |
| Writing the `logout` tool | [`skills/adding-login.md#do-i-need-a-logout-tool`](../docs/src/content/docs/skills/adding-login.md) | `abp.py::logout` |
| How auth resolution picks one cookie | [`architecture/auth-resolution.md`](../docs/src/content/docs/architecture/auth-resolution.md) | — |
| Shapes (ontology) | `../docs/shapes/*.yaml` | — |

## Universal rules for this repo

- **Credentials come from matchmaking, never from guesses.** In
  a `login` tool, call `credentials.retrieve(domain=".service.com",
  required=["email","password"])`. Never default a user email.
  Never reuse an email from one service for another — Joe uses a
  different address per provider.
- **`@connection("public")` for `login`; everything else uses
  the authed connection.** The `login` tool produces credentials,
  so it can't run on a connection that requires them.
- **Ship `check_session`, `login`, and `logout` together.** They
  are the three legs of the account protocol. The validator
  (`agent-sdk validate`) warns if `logout` is missing.
- **Cookies self-persist via `__cookie_delta__`.** The ambient
  Jar captures `Set-Cookie` during the handshake; the engine
  writes back on tool exit. Don't hand-roll cookie storage.
- **`@provides(login_credentials)` is the contract for 1Password,
  Keychain, and any future provider.** Callers say
  `credentials.retrieve(...)`, the engine dispatches every
  provider that declares the capability, freshest wins.
- **Three-path credential resolution in every `login` tool:**
  (1) explicit args, (2) `credentials.retrieve`,
  (3) `skill_error(code="NeedsCredentials", required=[...])`.
  Copy the template from `adding-login.md` §3.
- **For multi-step auth (OTP via SMS/email): two separate
  tools** — `send_login_code(email)` returns a `hint` the agent
  reads; `verify_login_code(email, code)` finishes. Agent reads
  the code via any `@provides(email_lookup)` skill (Gmail,
  Mimestream) or via iMessage SQL for SMS.
- **Never hardcode URLs to a password manager — use the
  provider capability.** `@provides(login_credentials)` skills
  today: `secrets/onepassword`, `macos/macos-keychain`.
- **Reverse engineering starts with CDP capture**, not body-only
  replay. See `docs/.../reverse-engineering/`. United's
  `requirements.md` is a good reference for what a thorough
  capture log looks like.

## Working here

- **Validate a skill:** `agent-sdk validate <skill>` from the
  `skills/` root.
- **Call a skill tool from CLI:** `agentos call run '{"skill":
  "united","tool":"check_session"}'`.
- **Restart the engine after Python changes:** not needed —
  Python workers hot-load. Only rebuild Rust (`./dev.sh restart`
  in `core/`) for engine changes.
- **Credential store:** `~/.agentos/data/agentos.db` (SQLite).
  Writes happen through `__secrets__` + `__cookie_delta__`
  sidebands — never open the DB directly from a skill.

## If a doc says "it depends"

Follow the reference implementation. The three canonical auth
shapes are:

| Shape | Skill | Why pick it |
|---|---|---|
| Cognito / Amplify (password + IdToken) | `fitness/austin-boulder-project/abp.py` | Provider handshake + portal follow-up |
| NextAuth + email OTP | `web/exa/exa.py` | Two-step flow, pure HTTP |
| Plain form POST + cookies | `media/goodreads/goodreads_web.py` | Simplest case |

If none of the three fit — your service does something weirder
— that's a reverse-engineering project. Start with CDP capture
and document the shape in the skill's own `requirements.md`
(see `logistics/united/requirements.md` for the style).
