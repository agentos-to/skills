# United Airlines — reverse engineering notes

Captured endpoints, auth details, and data shapes from united.com.

Reverse-engineered: 2026-04-23.

## Frontend stack

- **Custom React SPA** (NOT Next.js — no `__NEXT_DATA__`). Webpack chunks at
  `/public/<hash>/e/<N>.js` and root chunks at `/runtime.<hash>.js`,
  `/main.<hash>.js`, `/<N>.<hash>.js`.
- **State:** Redux with Immutable.js, persisted via `redux-persist` into
  IndexedDB at `localforage.keyvaluepairs.reduxPersist:global` (transit-js
  encoded).
- **Network:** axios; interceptor adds `X-Authorization-api: bearer <hash>`
  from Redux store's `apiToken.hash`.
- **Protection:** Akamai Bot Manager (obfuscated sensor data POSTs at
  randomized paths like `/favQ5fU6ptzCHIs0gPYD/6Lp3StQ9YwLE/...`). Cookie
  `bm_sz`, `_abck`, `bm_sv`, `bm_so`, `ak_bmsc`, `akavpau_ualwww`,
  `akacd_*`. HTTP/2 seems to work fine so far.
- **Tracking:** Optimizely, Qualtrics, Tealium, Dynatrace, Quantum Metric,
  Securiti.ai consent. Third-party scripts — none of them relevant to our
  replay surface.

## ⚠️ Akamai soft-block signature (learned the hard way)

When a POST to united.com returns **HTTP 200 + `Content-Type: application/x-ndjson` + `Content-Length: 0`**, this is **not** "malformed body". It's Akamai Bot Manager's **deception/tarpit action** silently dropping the response. Evidence:
- The response headers include `Server: volt-adc` (F5 Volterra edge), `x-accel-buffering: no` (stream wasn't buffered server-side — it's actually empty), and `Set-Cookie: akavpau_ualwww=...` (per-visitor auth cookie rotate — challenge signal).
- Malformed bodies return 400/500 with an error envelope.
- Reproduces even when **the same request is fired via `Runtime.evaluate` from inside the real Brave tab** (same JA4, same cookies, same everything).

**Implication for our skill**: don't replay POSTs against booking/state-change endpoints from Python urllib/http.client. Either:
1. Use `agentos.client` with `client="browser"` (bundles UA + Sec-CH-UA + Sec-Fetch-*); if the engine has wreq/BoringSSL support that's better still.
2. Drive the actual clicks via CDP on a live Brave session and **intercept** the XHR via `Fetch.enable` patterns — we read the real body the browser sent and the real response the browser got.

## Auth

### Cookie tier
Cookie domain `.united.com`. Critical cookies:

| Cookie | Purpose | Example prefix |
|--------|---------|----------------|
| `AuthCookie` | Opaque auth session token | hex64 chars |
| `Session` | Contains `AuthToken=DAAAAJ...` (URL-encoded). User-scope session. | `DAAAAJ` |
| `User` | Contains `RememberID=DAAAAP...`. "Remember me" credential. | `DAAAAP` |
| `PIM-SESSION-ID` | PIM-layer session ID | 16-char string |
| `1pc_session` | First-party session UUID | UUID |
| `_ucid` | User client ID hash | hex |
| `SID` | Presence marker (`true`) | bool string |

Akamai Bot Manager cookies (`bm_*`, `_abck`, `ak_bmsc`, `akavpau_*`,
`akacd_*`) — passed through; don't strip or Akamai will flag as bot.

### Bearer token tier

Short-lived bearer (~30 min TTL, `expiresAt` returned from mint endpoint).
Token envelope is a custom binary format, base64-encoded:

```
0c 00 00 00 <12 bytes ??> 10 00 00 00 <16 bytes ??> <payload...>
```

Different cookie values (`AuthCookie`, `Session.AuthToken`,
`User.RememberID`) all share this same envelope shape but carry different
payloads / lengths.

**Minting:** `GET /api/auth/anonymous-token` (with cookies). Despite the
name, it returns a USER-SCOPED token when valid session cookies are
present.

```
GET https://www.united.com/api/auth/anonymous-token
Cookie: Session=AuthToken=...; User=RememberID=...; AuthCookie=...; (+ Akamai cookies)
Accept: application/json

→ 200
{
  "data": {
    "token": {
      "hash": "DAAAAIFt0c/Mzq/xp8P...",     # the bearer
      "expiresAt": "2026-04-23T18:17:35.0000000+00:00"
    }
  }
}
```

Use the hash as `X-Authorization-api: bearer <hash>` on all subsequent API
calls. Refresh via the same endpoint when within ~5 min of `expiresAt`.

**Validation:** `GET /api/auth/validate-token` — accepts no bearer; returns
`{"valid": true|false, "TokenExpiration": "<seconds>"}` if a bearer is
sent. Also returns `{"valid": false}` (200) if called WITHOUT a bearer.
Useful for session-health check.

### Auth endpoints inventory

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| GET    | `/api/auth/anonymous-token` | Mint bearer (user-scoped if cookies) |
| GET    | `/api/auth/validate-token`  | Validate bearer |
| ?      | `/api/auth/refresh-token`   | (not probed yet; POST=405, GET probably=405) |
| ?      | `/api/auth/sso-token`       | SSO (not probed yet) |
| POST?  | `/xapi/auth/signin`         | Primary sign-in flow (reserve — user-driven only) |
| POST?  | `/api/auth/signInAfterEnroll` | Post-enroll signin |
| GET    | `/api/auth/signout`         | Sign out |
| POST?  | `/api/auth/randomsecurityquestions` | 2FA challenge |
| POST?  | `/api/auth/SubmitSecurityQuestionsResponses` | 2FA submit |

Plan: **never implement signin** — rely on cookie auth from Brave
(`brave-browser` provider), same pattern as Uber/Amazon skills. If session
expires, the skill returns `SESSION_EXPIRED:` and the engine retries with
fresher cookies.

## Read endpoints

Captured 2026-04-23 from an authenticated `manageres/mytrips` page load.
All require `X-Authorization-api: bearer <hash>`.

### User / account

| Method | Path | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|
| GET | `/xapi/myunited/User/profile` | Full profile: name, MP#, CustomerId, ProfileId, travelers array, title, addresses, phones. THE KEY ENDPOINT for a logged-in session. |
| GET | `/api/myunited/user/balances` | MileagePlus balances: miles (`RDM`), Plus Points Exchange, travel bank, chase certificates, PQPs. |
| GET | `/api/user/creditCards` | Saved cards (last 4, CC type, billing address, token handles). |
| GET | `/api/User/FutureFlightCreditsResiduals` | ETCCertificates, FFCRCertificates, FFCCertificates. |
| POST | `/api/User/ElectronicTravelCertificates?toCurrencyCode=USD` | Active travel certs. |

### Trips

| Method | Path | Body | Notes |
|--------|------|------|-------|
| POST | `/api/mytrips/MyTripsByMileagePlus/` | `{"NumberOfItineraries": int, "StartDate": "MM/DD/YYYY", "EndDate": "MM/DD/YYYY"}` | Upcoming trips. Empty `Data: []` if none. Accepts `NumberOfItineraries: 0` for count-only. |
| POST | `/api/user/trips` | `false` | Kicks off async trip backfill (202 Accepted). Likely polled via separate endpoint (TBD). |

### Reference data

| Method | Path | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|
| GET | `/api/referenceData/countries` | Country list with codes. |
| GET | `/api/referenceData/nearestAirport/{lat}/{lng}/{radius}/{resultLimit}` | Nearest airports. |
| GET | `/api/sdl/GetSDLRawContent?page=/ual/en/us/fly/_system/SearchPopularTerms.html` | CMS content. |
| GET | `/api/home/advisories` | Travel advisories. |

## Profile sub-endpoints (captured 2026-04-23 from `/en/us/account/profile`)

All return `{data: ...}` wrapping the actual payload. All require
bearer + cookies.

### Contact info

| Method | Path | Payload shape |
|--------|------|---------------|
| GET | `/api/user/phoneNumbers` | `.data.PhoneNumbers[]` — each has `ChannelCode`, `ChannelTypeCode` (H=Home, O=Other), `CountryCode`, `CountryPhoneNumber`, `AreaNumber`, `PhoneNumber`, `Description` ("Cell"/"Office"), `IsPrimary`, `IsDayOfTravel`, `PhoneDevices[].CommDeviceTypeCode` (WP=wireless phone), `IsVerified`, `VerificationDate`, `Key` (opaque handle for updates) |
| GET | `/api/user/emailAddresses` | `.data.EmailAddresses[]` — `EmailAddress`, `IsPrimary`, `IsDayOfTravel`, `IsVerified`, `Description` ("Home"/"Work"), `Key`. Also `.data.VerifyTrackId` for round-trip updates. |
| GET | `/api/user/addresses` | `.data.Addresses[]` — `AddressLine1`/`AddressLine2`, `City`, `StateCode`, `PostalCode`, `CountryCode`, `ChannelTypeCode` (H=Home), `IsPrimary`, `Key`. |

### Nationality / residence

| Method | Path | Payload |
|--------|------|---------|
| GET | `/api/myunited/user/residenceAndNationality` | `.data.CountryOfResidence` (ISO alpha-2), `.data.Nationality` (ISO alpha-2). **User may leave stale values here — don't treat as ground truth.** |

### Secure Flight / Known Traveler

| Method | Path | Payload shape |
|--------|------|---------------|
| GET | `/api/user/travelerSupplementaryTravelInfo` | `.data.SupplementaryTravelInfos[]` — each has `Number` (the ID digits), `SeqNumber`, `Type` (1-char code). Plus `.data.SecureTraveler` with `DocumentType` (1-char), `SequenceNumber`. |

**Observed `Type` codes** (partial — inferred from single-sample data; confirm as we add more memberships):
- `K` — Known Traveler Number (TSA PreCheck / Global Entry / Nexus — all share the KTN field)
- (not yet seen, plausible): `R` — Redress number. `P` — Passport. Probe when needed.

**Observed `SecureTraveler.DocumentType` codes** (partial):
- `C` — probably *citizen ID* or similar. Unconfirmed.

### Partner loyalty programs

| Method | Path | Payload shape |
|--------|------|---------------|
| GET | `/api/myunited/user/airlinePartnerLoyaltyAccounts` | `.data.FlightRewardProgramList[]` — `ProgramName`, `ProgramVendorName`, `ProgramID` (numeric), `ProgramMemberID` (FF number), `ProgramEnrollDate`, `AirPreferenceId`, `Key`. The user's United MileagePlus itself appears here as a row (ProgramID=7). |
| GET | `/api/referenceData/loyaltyPrograms/` | Reference list of all linkable airline loyalty programs (Star Alliance + partners). |

### Family / member linkage

| Method | Path | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|
| GET | `/xapi/myunited/memberlinkage` | Linked profiles. Returns `{status:"Failure", errors:[{code:"404","message":"Consent not found"}]}` when the user hasn't opted into family linkage — NOT an error, just "absent". Skill should treat as empty set. |

### Profile preferences (captured, not yet explored)

Lower-priority — capture bodies later if a tool needs them:

- `GET /api/myunited/user/PmdPreferences` — personal mobility device preferences
- `GET /api/myunited/user/Preferences` — general preferences
- `GET /api/myunited/user/marketingCommunicationPreferences` — email/SMS opt-in state
- `GET /api/myunited/user/petInCabin` — pet travel preferences
- `GET /api/myunited/user/serviceAnimals` — service animal preferences
- `GET /api/referenceData/MilitaryOrganizations` — reference list (for military fare eligibility)
- `GET /xapi/myunited/memberaffiliate/military/status` — military affiliation

## Graph modeling notes (from captures so far)

**Emails are on accounts, not persons.** Joe uses a per-provider email
pattern (e.g. `united@contini.co` for United, `anthropic@contini.co`
elsewhere) — an intentional spam-source detection scheme. Email belongs
on the `account` node (which is tied to the issuer / platform), not
duplicated onto `person`. United's `emailAddresses` payload → create
one `account` per email (issuer = "united.com" for the primary, or the
email's own domain if we want finer-grained tracking).

**Phone numbers — not modeled as their own shape yet.** They're owned
by the person but tied to a verification state and marked for
day-of-travel contact. Open question: add a `phone` shape, or put them
as string fields on `person`, or as an array on `account`? Current read
is that phones are Person-owned (they survive a platform rebrand /
account closure) but individual-verification-state is platform-scoped.
Probably a future `phone` shape with `holder: person` + `verifiedBy:
account[]` edges. Not urgent; leave out of v1.

**Addresses are places.** Each address entry → upsert `place` with
`fullAddress` / `city` / `region` / `postalCode` / `countryCode` and
link `person --has_address--> place` with the `ChannelTypeCode` (Home/
Business) as an edge value. Multiple addresses = multiple edges.

**KTN = `membership` at TSA.** Per our agreed model:
- `membership.at` → the TSA organization (separate `organization` node)
- `membership.id` → the KTN digits
- `membership.tier` → "PreCheck" / "Global Entry" / "Nexus" / "SENTRI"
  (inferred from which program issued the KTN — United doesn't say which)

Since United's API only gives us `Number` + `Type: "K"` without telling
us WHICH program issued it, we can't distinguish PreCheck vs Global
Entry from United alone. A future skill (e.g. `tsa` skill or a Global
Entry lookup) could enrich. For now, surface it as `Known Traveler
Number` with tier = null.

**Partner loyalty programs = `membership[]` per airline.** One
`membership` per airline in `FlightRewardProgramList` (excluding United
itself, which is already surfaced as MileagePlus). `at` = the partner
airline, `id` = `ProgramMemberID`, `published` = `ProgramEnrollDate`.

## Flight search

### Endpoint

```
POST https://www.united.com/api/flight/FetchSSENestedFlights
X-Authorization-api: bearer <hash>
Content-Type: application/json
Accept: text/event-stream  (response is SSE)
```

**Response is a Server-Sent Events stream** (Content-Type isn't `application/json`;
each line is `data: <json>\n\n`). A CDP `getResponseBody` on a finished SSE
request often returns empty — you must tee the stream while it's in flight
(in the skill: read line-by-line from the HTTP response).

### Deep-link URL (drives the React SPA to fire the search automatically)

```
https://www.united.com/en/us/fsr/choose-flights
  ?f=AUS              origin IATA
  &t=SFO              destination IATA
  &d=2026-04-28       outbound date (YYYY-MM-DD)
  &r=2026-05-03       return date (YYYY-MM-DD, round-trip)
  &px=1               passenger count
  &tt=1               trip type (1 = round-trip, 0 = one-way?)
  &taxng=1            taxes included in displayed prices
  &clm=7              cabin code (7 = Economy including Basic)
  &st=bestmatches     sort order
  &idx=1              slice index (1 = outbound first, 2 = return)
  &mm=0               money+miles toggle
```

### Request body (captured)

```json
{
  "SearchTypeSelection": 1,
  "SortType": "bestmatches",
  "SortTypeDescending": false,
  "Trips": [
    {
      "Origin": "AUS",
      "Destination": "SFO",
      "DepartDate": "2026-04-28",
      "Index": 1,

          "IsTravelCreditsApplied": false,
          "IsDoveFlow": true
        }
      }
    }
  ],
  "CabinPreferenceMain": "economy",
  "PaxInfoList": [
    {"PaxType": 1}
  ],
  "AwardTravel": false,

    {"Code": "UsePassedCartId", "Value": false}
  ],
  "FareType": "Refundable",
  "BuildHashValue": "true",
  "EnableBasicPremiumProducts": true
}
```

**Key observations**:
- `Trips[]` contains ONE slice at a time. Round-trip search fires twice: once for outbound (Index=1), once for return (Index=2) after the outbound is chosen.
- `PaxInfoList[].PaxType`: 1 = ADT (adult). Other codes presumed: 2/3 for CHILD, INF.
- `CabinPreferenceMain`: "economy" | "business" | "first" (verified: economy).
- `CabinPreference` / `clm` URL param mapping needs a second capture to confirm ("clm=7" = Economy including Basic, vs some other number for business).
- `EnableBasicPremiumProducts: true` surfaces Basic Economy as a fare option. Set to `false` to hide.
- `AwardTravel: true` switches to miles pricing.

### Response SSE event types (seen in AUS→SFO Apr 28 Basic Economy search)

Events arrive in order. Each `data: <json>\n\n`.

      // ... more products for higher cabins (Economy Plus, First) ...
    ]
  }
}
```

**To select a flight**: grab the `productId` from the chosen product. That's
the booking token the next step needs. The `cartId` from the `meta` event
threads the session. The `hash` dedupes the same flight appearing in
multiple results.

### Captured example: Joe's search

File: `.captures/search-body.txt` — full SSE stream for AUS→SFO
Apr 28 Economy (including Basic), 1 passenger, 418KB, 32 flight options.

**The 1:00 PM flight from the screenshot = UA 1336, option #2 in stream:**
- UA 1336 AUS→SFO, depart 13:00, arrive 15:02 local, 4h02, 737-900 / B738
- Basic Economy: $210 (N class)
- Standard Economy: $260 (L class)
- (plus Economy Plus, First at higher prices; nested in products[0].nestedProducts)

## Flight selection — **actually `RegisterFlights`, not `SelectAndFetch`**

I burned a lot of cycles assuming `/api/flight/SelectAndFetchSSENestedFlights`
was the "select outbound + search return" call. **It's not.** Live capture
of the actual "Basic Economy works for me → Select" click shows the SPA fires
**`POST /api/flight/RegisterFlights`** with a tiny body:

### Endpoint

```
POST https://www.united.com/api/flight/RegisterFlights
X-Authorization-api: bearer <hash>
Content-Type: application/json
```

### Request body (captured live on UA 1336 $259 Basic click)

```json
{
  "CartId": "2D7A02F9-C94F-476A-ADE2-04EE5CACBAE0",
  "BBXCellId": "VAU4pbMyP90PjjnrkiUqEA006",
  "MoneyAndMilesOptionId": null,
  "BBXSolutionSetId": null,
  "flightHash": "118-1336-UA",
  "RequeryForUpsell": false,
  "CalendarFilters": {"Filters": {"PriceScheduleOptions": {"Stops": 1}}},
  "FareType": "Refundable",
  "BuildHashValue": "true",
  "Characteristics": [
    {"Code": "IsNewRTI", "Value": "true"},
    {"Code": "fsrQueryParam", "Value": "?tt=1&st=bestmatches&d=2026-04-28&...&idx=1&mm=0&cartId=undefined"}
  ]
}
```

### Key observations on selection

- **`BBXCellId` is NOT the `productId` from search results.** The search gave us `VAU4pbMyP90PjjnrkiUqEA002` (suffix `002`); the click sent `VAU4pbMyP90PjjnrkiUqEA006` (suffix `006`). **The suffix maps to the fare-column ID** (basic, standard, plus, first). So the frontend takes the product-hash prefix and concatenates the chosen fare column. This needs confirming by capturing different fare clicks — TBD.
- **`flightHash` = `118-1336-UA`** — matches the `hash` field in the `flightOption` event.
- **`CartId` is the one from the SSE `meta` event** — thread from search → register.
- **`Characteristics.fsrQueryParam`** is the whole `?tt=1&...` URL query string from the choose-flights page. Frontend literally forwards the URL query. Possibly signal.
- **`IsNewRTI: "true"`** — probably "use the new Review Trip Itinerary UI". Safe to always send true.

### Response shape

`RegisterFlights` returns a **non-streaming JSON** envelope:

```

    "DisplayCart": {
      "CartId": "...",
      "GrandTotal": 308.4,             // base + taxes
      "SearchType": 1,
      "DisplayTravelers": [{...}],     // currently just logged-in user's DOB

      ],
      "DisplayPrices": [...],
      "DisplayFees": [...],
      ...
    }
  }
}
```

**Round-trip**: even though our search was `tt=1` (round-trip), the Register
response `DisplayTrips` only shows **1 trip** (AUS→SFO). Yet the URL
transitioned directly to `/traveler/choose-travelers?cartId=...&tqp=R`
(tqp=R = Round-trip query param). That's weird — **one Register commits the
outbound AND skips the return slice**. Two plausible explanations:
1. The "search" phase was actually one-way under the hood (despite `tt=1`)
2. There's an additional Register call for the return leg we didn't capture
   because it happened too fast (but we monitored 45s of intercept — we'd
   have caught it).

TBD: start a round-trip search fresh, carefully click outbound, observe.

### Sidecar calls fired alongside Register (same click)

These are display/upsell enrichment — the skill does NOT need to call them to book:

| Method | Path | Body summary | Purpose |
|--------|------|--------------|---------|
| GET | `/xapi/myunited/User/profile` | — | (re-fetch profile, probably to show miles earning preview) |
| POST | `/api/flight/GetSpecialMealsEligibility` | Full FlightSegment dicts for each segment | Meal ordering eligibility per segment |
| POST | `/api/Flight/GetProducts` (note capital F) | `{CartId, ProductCodes: ["BAG"], Characteristics: [{Code: "OverrideBagPolicy", Value: "GeneralMember"}]}` | Baggage pricing/policy for current cart |
| POST | `/api/Flight/GetProducts` (second call) | `{CartId, ProductCodes: ["FLK"], ...}` | Flight change/cancel policy ("FLK" = flight ??) |

Both `GetProducts` calls return essentially the same 40KB cart snapshot.

## Post-selection — traveler page

URL pattern: `/en/us/traveler/choose-travelers?cartId=<UUID>&tqp=R`
(tqp=R = Round-trip; `tqp=O` would be one-way; `tqp=MC` multi-city).

**Note on `tqp`:** this URL param does NOT appear to actually toggle
round-trip vs one-way. A search fired with `tt=1` (alleged round-trip)
completed `RegisterFlights` and advanced to this page with `tqp=R` — but
`SearchType: 1` in the cart, and only 1 DisplayTrip, and the price
panel says "ONEWAY (1 TRAVELER)". Either `tt=1` means something else, or
the search was implicitly downgraded to one-way because the return date
never entered the Register call. **Round-trip booking path still TBD.**

### Form state (captured from `/en/us/traveler/choose-travelers`)

Form name: `rtiTraveler.travelers[i].*`. One row per traveler.

| Field name                                                    | Example value            |

### Saved travelers dropdown

`/xapi/myunited/User/profile` → `data.profile.Travelers[]` holds saved
travelers under the same account. Each has its own `CustomerId` (numeric,
stable) even though they share a `MileagePlusId` (the profile owner's).
The dropdown maps the array index onto `rtiTraveler.travelers[i].travelerSelectedIndex`.

Captured for Joe (2 travelers):
- `CustomerId: 53955798, MP: XX118941` — Mr. Giuseppe Efisio Contini, DOB 1987-01-25, PTCCode `PPR`
- `CustomerId: 179221772, MP: XX118941` — Priyanka Raina, DOB 1992-02-15, PTCCode null

**Per-traveler Traveler object** from `/xapi/myunited/User/profile.data.profile.Travelers[i]`:
```
{
  CustomerId, MileagePlusId, TitleCode, CustomerName,
  FirstName, MiddleName, LastName, BirthDate ("1987-01-25T00:00:00"),
  GenderCode, CountryOfResidence, EliteDetails: {EliteStatus, Tier},
  CustomerMetrics: {PTCCode, ...},
  Addresses: [...], EmailAddresses: [...], CreditCards: [...],
  AirPreferences, DisplayPreferences, BehaviorSegments, Donor,
  HistoricalPartnerCards, ...
}
```

Weird names to note:
- `AreaCityCode` actually holds the country calling code (`1`), not the area code
- `CountryAccessCode` holds the ISO country name (`US`), not an int
- `Documents[].Type: 15` = Secure Flight / KTN doc type per United's internal enum

### Endpoints that fired alongside / after RegisterTravelers

```
GET  /api/ShoppingCart/LoadReservationAndCart?cartId=<UUID>
GET  /xapi/myunited/User/profile  (re-fetch)
POST /api/User/ElectronicTravelCertificates?toCurrencyCode=USD
GET  /api/User/FutureFlightCreditsResiduals
```

The page then navigates to
`https://www.united.com/en/us/book-flight/customizetravel/<CartId>?tqp=R`
— the "customize travel" / upsell + seats + ancillaries page.

### Other booking endpoints (to capture on next pages)

From the bundle's URL inventory at `.captures/chunks/main.b74efa9bde4258f132bb.js`:

- POST `/api/Flight/SelectedFlights`
- POST `/api/Flight/FetchUpsell`
- POST `/api/ShoppingCart/RegisterOffers`
- POST `/api/ShoppingCart/RegisterSeats` (if seats picked)
- POST `/api/ShoppingCart/checkout`

## Customize travel — bundle offers

URL: `https://www.united.com/en/us/book-flight/customizetravel/<CartId>?tqp=R`

Reached after `RegisterTravelers`. Shows "Travel add-ons" with 3 bundle
cards (sometimes fewer/more). **No separate API fires to fetch bundles** —
the bundle data is already in `/api/ShoppingCart/LoadReservationAndCart`'s
response, but buried in a path the grep for "bundle"/"offer"/"merch"
didn't hit. The SPA hydrates React state from there.

**How to extract bundles from the page directly** (bypassing the
LoadReservationAndCart parse entirely — the React `bundleOffers` prop
has the clean normalized shape):

```js
// In the page context — via Runtime.evaluate:
(async () => {
  const h3 = Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('h3')).find(h => /Bundle Offer 1/i.test(h.textContent));
  let root = h3.parentElement;
  const fk = Object.keys(root).find(k => k.startsWith('__reactFiber$'));
  let fiber = root[fk];
  while (fiber) {
    if (Array.isArray(fiber.memoizedProps?.bundleOffers)) {
      return fiber.memoizedProps.bundleOffers;
    }
    fiber = fiber.return;
  }
})()
```

**bundleOffers prop shape** (verified live for AUS→SFO UA 1336):

```jsonc

            "amount": 81.7,           // WITH tax
            "baseAmount": 76,         // WITHOUT tax

          }
        ],
        "extension": { "Bundle": {  // full bundle contents
          "Products": [
            {"Code":"EPU", "SubProducts":[{"Descriptions":["E+ Ltd Recline Exit Middle"], ...}]}
          ]
        }}
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    "code": "B14",
    "isPopularBundle": true,
    "startingFromAmount": 104,
    "subProducts": [{
      "name": "Economy Plus and Extra Bag",
      "prices": [{"id": "B14-SOL1_OD1_1_0", "amount": 109.4, "baseAmount": 104, ...}]
    }]
  },
  {
    "code": "B18",
    "isPopularBundle": false,
    "startingFromAmount": 97,
    "subProducts": [{
      "name": "Economy Plus and Priority Boarding",
      "prices": [{"id": "B18-SOL1_OD1_1_0", "amount": 102.55, "baseAmount": 97, ...}]
    }]
  }
]
```

Bundle naming: `B01` = Economy Plus seat alone. Higher codes combine
products. `"B14"` with **Most Popular** flag is the 2-in-1 (seat + bag).
`B18` pairs seat + priority boarding.

Inputs on the page are named `check-offer-OD1` with values `0/1/2` (indices
into the bundleOffers array). Selecting one **probably** fires
`POST /api/ShoppingCart/RegisterOffers` with the price `id`
(`B14-SOL1_OD1_1_0` etc.) — **TBD: capture on click**.

```

## MileagePlus / membership activity (not yet captured)

Joe's framing: this is "membership activity" not "flight activity" — miles
are a currency of the MileagePlus membership; not every miles transaction
came from a flight (credit card earnings, partner hotels, etc.). TBD when
user navigates to that view.

## TODO

- [x] Flight-select / pricing call — `RegisterFlights` is the one, not `SelectAndFetchSSENestedFlights`.
- [ ] Confirm round-trip: does the return slice need a second Register, or does the URL `tqp=R` param auto-book return at some later step?
- [ ] BBXCellId construction — capture clicks on different fare columns (Standard, First) to see how the suffix changes.
- [ ] Seat map endpoint (/api/ShoppingCart/RegisterSeats?)
- [ ] Traveler details submission (names, KTN, FF#, contact info) — NEXT capture
- [ ] Payment endpoint
- [ ] PNR creation confirmation (where does the record locator come back?)
- [ ] Award search (`AwardTravel: true`)
- [ ] Past trips / flight history — URL guess 404'd. Will capture when user
      finds the right UI control.
- [ ] MileagePlus miles activity (transactions)
- [ ] Boarding pass / check-in endpoints
- [ ] PNR lookup by record locator (for non-MileagePlus trips)

## Data provenance (from profile endpoint)

`/xapi/myunited/User/profile` → `.data.profile`:

| Field | Value example |
|-------|---------------|
| `CustomerId` | `53955798` |
| `ProfileId` | `19218370` |
| `ProfileOwnerId` | `53955798` (self-profile) |
| `ProfileMembersCount` | null (no linked travelers yet) |
| `Travelers[0].CustomerId` | `53955798` |
| `Travelers[0].MileagePlusId` | `XX118941` |
| `Travelers[0].TitleCode` | `Mr.` |
| `Travelers[0].CustomerName` | `Mr. Giuseppe Efisio Contini` |
| `Travelers[0].FirstName` | `Giuseppe` |
| `Travelers[0].MiddleName` | `Efisio` |
| `Travelers[0].LastName` | `Contini` |
| `Travelers[0].CustomerMetrics.PTCCode` | `PPR` (passenger type: Paid PRemier? or "Per Person Request") |
| ... | (more fields: addresses, phones, elite status) |

## Data provenance (balances)

`/api/myunited/user/balances` → `.data.Balances[]`:

| ProgramCurrencyType | Meaning |
|---------------------|---------|
| `RDM` | Redeemable miles (regular MileagePlus balance) |
| `UGC` | United gift card / unified ?gift credits |
| `UBC` | United travel Bank Credits |
| `CAC` | ?Certificate CAC |
| `PPE` | Plus Points Exchange |
| `FQP` | FlexPay / Flex Qualifying Points |
| `CHC` | Choice balance |
| `PQP` | Premier Qualifying Points (current year) |
| `PQF` | Premier Qualifying Flights |

And `.data.Certificates.Chase[]`: `CAV`, `CED`, `CEG`, `CBV`, `CAC` —
Chase-issued certificates for MileagePlus credit cardholders.

## Write endpoints (not yet captured)

Booking a flight, checkout, seat selection, check-in, etc. — capture in a
separate session when we actually book something.

## Known quirks

- **Akamai sensor POSTs:** randomized paths (`/favQ5fU6ptzCHIs0gPYD/...`),
  obfuscated bodies. Must pass through; don't drop.
- **`NumberOfItineraries: 0`** legitimately returns `{Data: [], EData: []}` —
  empty is valid, doesn't imply error.
- **`X-Authorization-api`** header name is case-sensitive in some places
  (`X-` capitalization). Safest to match the browser exactly.
- **`credentials: 'include'`** required on fetch — `SameSite` on cookies.
- **`expiresAt`** is ISO-8601 with 7 fractional second digits + `+00:00`
  offset.
- **Checkout-flow idle timeout signs you out.** Sitting on the
  `/customizetravel/<CartId>` page for ~5min while NOT clicking things
  causes United to fire `GET /api/auth/signout` (clearing `AuthCookie`,
  `User`, `SID`) and returns 403 on the subsequent
  `/api/ShoppingCart/LoadReservationAndCart`. The cart survives (URL still
  has the cart ID), but the session is cooked. **The skill MUST run the
  booking flow (register → traveler → offers → seats → checkout) without
  long pauses.** Inspection/probing must happen either before starting,
  or after PNR generation.

## Tools for ongoing capture

- `core/bin/browse-capture.py` — the standard RE toolkit CDP capturer.
- `.captures/capture.py` — local helper that captures via CDP (request +
  response bodies, per-session JSONL). Idle mode for manually driving a
  user flow. **Caveat:** this script flushes on clean exit only — Ctrl-C
  during the idle pump loses data. Use `/tmp/fix-capture.py` for
  flush-on-each-event behavior.
- **`/tmp/united-click-and-capture.py`** — the winning pattern: attach to
  Brave, enable `Fetch.enable` interception for `/api/flight/*` + `/xapi/*`,
  drive clicks via `Runtime.evaluate`, drain SSE streams via
  `Fetch.takeResponseBodyAsStream` + `IO.read` loop, fulfill requests so
  the browser keeps working. **This is the reliable way to capture
  state-change XHRs** — no SSE buffering issues, no TLS fingerprint
  mismatch, bodies always intact.
- Chunks pulled to `.captures/chunks/` for static analysis. Main chunk:
  `main.b74efa9bde4258f132bb.js` (~5.6MB).

## Discovered strings (actions/constants)

From `main.b74efa9bde4258f132bb.js`:

- Redux state key: `apiToken.hash` (Immutable Map)
- Action strings: `unitedapp/App/*` prefix
- Header constant: `"X-Authorization-api"` → `"bearer ".concat(e.hash)`
- Endpoints baked in: see table above

## Seatmap (post-traveler-page)

URL pattern: `/en/us/book-flight/seatmap/<CartId>?tqp=R`

### `POST /api/SeatMap/Retrieve`

Fires on seatmap page load. Returns full aircraft cabin data with every
seat, pricing tier, monuments (galley/lavatory/exit), and wing/exit row
flags. Response is ~300KB+ of rich JSON.

### Rendering a cabin from this data

Merge `rows` + `monumentRows` into one sorted list by `verticalGridNumber`.
Walk in order — seat rows emit seats indexed by letter; monument rows emit
headers ("LAVATORY", "GALLEY", "DOOR/EXIT" if `isDoorExit: true`).

Example ASCII render for UA 1336 (captured 2026-04-23):

```

```

Legend: ✕=occupied, ○=free available, $=paid available, █=blocked, ·=no seat.

**Important rendering notes:**
- Rows are numbered non-contiguously (e.g. skip from 8→10, 12→14, 32→34).
  Missing numbers are airline convention (skip 13, skip 15-19 for 737
  config variant) — don't synthesize missing rows.
- `row.wing: true` marks rows physically over the wing.
- `seat.isExit: true` marks seats on an **exit row** (legal requirement:
  adult, able-bodied, etc.). `monument.isDoorExit: true` marks an actual
  aircraft door location between rows.
- `seat.isBlocked` = blocked by airline (e.g. middle rows held back as
  "elite only"). Shown as blocked squares in the UI.
- `tier` on a seat is a lookup key into `tiers[i].id`. `tiers[i].pricing[0]
  .totalPrice` is the per-seat charge (pre-tax).
- Tiers 8-19 (Basic Economy etc.) have `totalPrice: 0` and
  `eligibility: "Seat selection not eligible for ELF Fare"` — meaning the
  fare class doesn't allow paid seat selection at all.

### What determines a seat's availability

```
if not isAvailable:
  if isBlocked or isPermanentBlocked: "blocked"    (airline held back)
  elif isOccupied:                   "occupied"
  elif isHeld:                       "held"        (another traveler mid-checkout)
  else:                              "unavailable"
```

### Other seatmap signals
- `isReserveSeat`: airline-reserved seat (e.g. pilot jumpseat, crew rest)
- `isBassinet`: bassinet mount available at this seat
- `allowPet`, `allowLapInfant`, `allowUnAccompaniedMinor`,
  `allowDisabledPassenger`, `allowPrisonerGuard`: booking-rule flags
- `iataAttributes`: list of IATA standard attribute codes (e.g. `"1A"` =
  window, `"8"` = no seat recline) — gives portable cross-airline
  attributes even if United's own naming differs

### `aircraftInfo.icr`

ICR code (e.g. `C3E`) is United's internal aircraft configuration code.
Maps to aircraft type + cabin layout revision. Not the same as tail
number. For displaying "737-800" etc., cross-reference from the earlier
search response's `equipmentDisclosures.equipmentType`/`equipmentDescription`.

## Drive pattern that actually worked (lessons learned 2026-04-23)

After several false starts, this sequence worked end-to-end:

1. **Verify login via cookies first** (`Network.getCookies` for
   AuthCookie/User/SID present). If missing, the whole flow will fail
   silently on `LoadReservationAndCart` 403.
2. **Don't deep-link to `/fsr/choose-flights` cold** — the SPA may not
   kick off `FetchSSENestedFlights` if it thinks the state is already
   cached. Instead: navigate to `united.com/en/us` first, then to the
   `/fsr/choose-flights?f=AUS&t=SFO&d=...&r=...` URL (round-trip URL
   auto-fires search).
3. **Round-trip URL renders `Select flight` buttons, not `Select a fare`**
   — the matrix UI for round-trip shows price cards per (flight × cabin).
   Click the `$<price>` button inside the row for the target flight.
   One-way URLs (`tt=0`) caused "unable to complete your request" on our
   session, so stick with round-trip URL even if you only want one-way;
   the Register call will treat it as one-way based on body.
4. **Scope button finders to the UA row ancestor** — `document.querySelectorAll('button')`
   globally finds 30+ unrelated buttons. Walk up from a DOM leaf with
   "UA <number>" text until you find a Flight container, then `querySelectorAll`
   within it.
5. **After Select fare → "Basic Economy works for me" toggle → Select**
   — the `Select` button is disabled until the toggle is clicked (on
   Basic Economy fares only).
6. **Each page fires different endpoints** — `RegisterFlights` on the
   Select click, `RegisterTravelers` on traveler-page Continue,
   `SeatMap/Retrieve` on seatmap page load. Don't pause between clicks;
   the session idles out after ~5min.
7. **`Fetch.enable` breaks SSE** — only use passive `Network.enable`
   capture. Exclude SSE endpoints from any intercept list.

## Next session: capture round-trip booking (2026-04-23)

Everything above is one-way. The skill stops short of checkout, and it
only models a single `RegisterFlights` call for a single outbound
segment. To book a round-trip we need to extend the flow.

### Goal

Book the round-trip AUS↔SFO Joe picked originally:
- **Outbound** Tue Apr 28 UA 1336, 1:00 PM → 3:02 PM AUS→SFO (known, $210 Basic)
- **Return** Sun May 3, 5:10 PM → 10:55 PM SFO→AUS (nonstop, 3h 45m — UA flight number TBD; find via fresh search)

End-to-end via the skill, **using CDP to drive the UI** only where the
HTTP replay fails. Stop short of the final checkout POST (no payment).

### Start of session checklist

1. `boot()` via agentOS MCP to pick up state.
2. Verify Brave CDP: `curl -s http://127.0.0.1:9222/json`. If nothing
   on `united.com`, navigate to `https://www.united.com/en/us` and
   confirm login via `Network.getCookies` — `AuthCookie`, `User`, `SID`
   must all be present. If missing, ask Joe to log in. DO NOT try
   driving the flow while logged-out; everything 403s.
3. `check_session` via the skill — should return `united:XX118941`.
4. Read this file (requirements.md) tail. The Drive pattern that
   actually worked (2026-04-23) section is the known-good UI
   selectors.

### Hypothesis A: two RegisterFlights calls with shared CartId

Most airline booking APIs split the round-trip into two selection
calls. Try this first — the skill change is small:

1. `search_flights(origin=AUS, destination=SFO, depart_date=2026-04-28, return_date=2026-05-03)` — today the skill ignores `return_date`. Fix: fire one search for each slice. The search body's `Trips[]` takes one segment at a time anyway (we verified in the 2026-04-23 captures). For a round-trip session, fire search twice with `TripIndex: 1` for outbound and `TripIndex: 2` for return, sharing the `CartId` from the first search's `meta` event via `UsePassedCartId: true`.
2. `select_flight(cart_id, booking_token=<outbound>, flight_hash=<outbound>)` — same as today, but on success don't advance to traveler page. Inspect the `DisplayCart.SearchType` field — it should be 2 for round-trip (we saw 1 for one-way).
3. `select_flight(cart_id, booking_token=<return>, flight_hash=<return>, trip_index=2)` — NEW optional param. Probably maps to `TripIndex: 2` in the RegisterFlights body.
4. After both slices registered, the cart should show TWO DisplayTrips with a combined GrandTotal. Then `register_traveler`, `get_seatmap` twice (once per slice), `register_seats` optionally per slice.

### Hypothesis B: one RegisterFlights with two SelectedProducts

Less likely but possible — the body could carry an array of
`{ProductId, TripIndex}` entries. If Hypothesis A fails with a
"missing slice" error, try this body shape in a one-shot Register
call.

### Falling back to CDP capture

If both hypotheses fail or return confusing errors, **capture the
real frontend round-trip flow** with the same pattern used on 2026-04-23:

1. Start `python3 /tmp/united-intercept-safe.py 600 /tmp/rt-intercept.json` (or rewrite a fresh intercept script — it's <100 lines). **Exclude SSE endpoints** (FetchSSENestedFlights, SelectAndFetchSSENestedFlights) from the Fetch.enable patterns; passive Network.enable handles them.
2. Drive via `Runtime.evaluate`:
   - Navigate to `https://www.united.com/en/us/fsr/choose-flights?f=AUS&t=SFO&d=2026-04-28&r=2026-05-03&px=1&tt=1&taxng=1&clm=7&st=bestmatches&idx=1&mm=0` (round-trip URL already has `r=<return-date>` and `tt=1`).
   - Wait for flight cards. The round-trip UI shows `Select flight` buttons (NOT `Select a fare`). Scope to the UA 1336 row ancestor.
   - Click the cheapest `Select flight` → fare panel → "Basic Economy works for me" → `Select`.
   - This transitions the URL to `idx=2` for the RETURN slice. Wait for return-flight cards, pick the 5:10 PM return, repeat the select+toggle+select dance.
   - Record every XHR between the first and second Select click — that's the round-trip delta.
3. Diff the captured `RegisterFlights` body for the return slice against the outbound to see the `TripIndex` / `SelectedProducts` fields.

### Expected new fields / endpoints (speculative, verify on capture)

- `RegisterFlights` body: `TripIndex: 2` OR top-level `SelectedProducts: [{ProductId: <return>, TripIndex: 2}]` OR new endpoint.
- After both slices registered: URL probably jumps straight to `/traveler/` since the cart is complete.
- `get_seatmap` may need to be called TWICE — once per segment (different `SegmentNumber`).
- `register_traveler` is probably fine unchanged — the traveler is the same person for both legs.
- `register_seats` needs to handle `OriginalSegmentIndex` / `LegIndex` for the return-slice seat.

### Skill changes to anticipate

- `search_flights`: add `return_date` handling (fire two searches, merge offers).
- `select_flight`: add `trip_index` param (default 1); handle two-call sequences with shared CartId.
- `select_round_trip` convenience wrapper: takes outbound_token + return_token + cart_id + hashes, does both calls in order.
- `get_seatmap`: accept `segment_number` (already does); caller loops over segments for round-trip.
- Possibly new `get_cart` tool that calls `LoadReservationAndCart` and returns a normalized snapshot (total, selected trips, traveler state, seats) — useful for mid-flow status checks.

### Shape open question: how to model round-trip price breakdown

A round-trip `reservation` has ONE grand total but two `trips[]`. Each
leg has its own base fare; taxes often apply per-segment. The current
reservation shape has `totalAmount`/`baseAmount`/`taxAmount` at the
top level. For round-trip we may want `perTrip: {tripId: {base, tax, total}}`
in `_conditions` or as a new per-trip breakdown. Don't over-engineer
before we see the actual cart data.

### Stop before payment

The final `/api/ShoppingCart/checkout` or similar endpoint is
**out of scope**. Capture it for reference but DO NOT call it. Joe
will never put his card into this skill — if he wants to book for
real he does it in the browser. The skill's value is everything
up to the moment of charge.

### Free seats — quick win before round-trip

Joe asked: are any seats free on UA 1336? Answer from today's
captures: **no — all available seats have a paid tier on Basic Economy
fares.** That's United's Basic-Economy policy (tiers 8-19 are flagged
`eligibility: "Seat selection not eligible for ELF Fare"` with
`totalPrice: 0`, meaning "pick nothing, get assigned at check-in").
A paid non-Basic fare (Standard Economy $260+) unlocks free seat
selection in Main Cabin. Worth surfacing this in `get_seatmap`'s
return — add a `freeEconomySeatsAvailable: boolean` derived by
checking if any non-paid tier has `eligibility` matching "Eligible".

## Round-trip booking — what we actually learned (2026-04-23 session 2)

### The round-trip cart signal (open mystery)

Body-only HTTP replay cannot create a `SearchType: 2` (round-trip)
cart. We tried, in escalating combinations:

- `Trips[0].TripIndex: 2` + `UsePassedCartId: true` in the search body
- `Referer: .../fsr/choose-flights?...&r=<return>&sc=7,7&tt=1&...`
- `Characteristics[].fsrQueryParam` echoed in the RegisterFlights body
- `POST /api/FlexPricer/CalendarPricing` priming call with `IsOneway: false`
  **before** the search (this is what the SPA fires from the homepage
  when the user picks dates; it carries `Return: 05032026` and
  `Depart: 04282026` in the body)

All four together still produce `SearchType: 1` (one-way) carts. The
server-side bit that flips a cart to round-trip is **not reachable from
our HTTP client's vantage point** via any signal we've identified.
Suspects not yet ruled out:

- A session-scoped server-side attribute set during the homepage nav
  itself (a cookie, or a server-side session var).
- The `pst=NXo%3D-G-C` param in the round-trip choose-flights URL —
  this is "page state token", opaque, likely has the round-trip flag
  baked in via HMAC or similar.
- Ordering: the SPA fires `CalendarPricing` *before* the navigation
  POST to `/en/us`, not after.

What DOES work: drive the SPA via CDP from the homepage (click the
round-trip radio, fill origin/destination/dates via `setDepart`/`setReturn`
on the datepicker fiber, click "Find flights"). The resulting cart
becomes round-trip. Everything else — `select_flight`, `register_traveler`,
`get_seatmap`, `get_cart` — works pure-Python against that cart.

### The two-variant search body

The SPA uses two different FetchSSENestedFlights body shapes:

- **Outbound (idx=1)**: `SearchTypeSelection: 1` with full `Trips[0]`
  (origin, destination, depart date, fare family). Standard shape.
- **Return (idx=2, existing cart)**: `SearchTypeSelection: 3` with
  `Trips: []` (empty). The server fills in the slice from the cart's
  committed outbound. `RecentSearchKey` must be empty.

`search_flights` now emits the type-3 variant when `cart_id` is passed
with `trip_index >= 2`. It's necessary for the return search to stay on
the same cart — a type-1 return search allocates a fresh cart instead.

### CalendarPricing priming endpoint

```
POST /api/FlexPricer/CalendarPricing
Referer: https://www.united.com/en/us
{
  "UserSelected": true,
  "Depart": "04282026",          // MMDDYYYY
  "Return": "05032026",          // MMDDYYYY
  "Origin": "AUS",
  "Destination": "SFO",
  "IsAward": false,
  "ClientCurrentDate": "",
  "IsPremium": false,
  "IsOneway": false,             // ← the one that looks like it should matter
  "ExcludeBasicEconomy": false,
  "Travelers": { "Adult": 1, "Senior": 0, "Infant": 0, "InfantOnLap": 0,
                 "Children01": 0, "Children02": 0, "Children03": 0, "Children04": 0 }
}
```

Fires from homepage when dates are picked. We wired `search_flights`
to call this before the actual flight search when `return_date` is
set — doesn't flip SearchType on its own but matches the SPA's call
chain, which is probably load-bearing for other things.

### LoadReservationAndCart requires SPA's query params

Calling `/api/ShoppingCart/LoadReservationAndCart?cartId=<UUID>` with
just `cartId` returns a generic `{"Error":{"Errors":[{"Message":"We're
sorry, we are having connection issues. Please try your transaction
again."}]}}`. The SPA sends additional query params the server expects:

```
GET /api/ShoppingCart/LoadReservationAndCart
  ?cartId=<UUID>
  &workFlowType=1
  &clearBundles=false
  &clearSeats=false
  &isConfirmationPage=false
```

With those, it returns 200 with the full cart. Response envelope is
`Data.CartData.DisplayCart`, not `Data.DisplayCart` (different nesting
from RegisterFlights/RegisterTravelers responses — accept both in
parsing). This is wired in `get_cart`.

### Booking flow — complete page + endpoint map (2026-04-23)

Verified end-to-end on cart `76695CE3`. Page sequence AFTER a round-trip
cart is born (via SPA drive on homepage):

| # | URL / Endpoint | Trigger | What it does |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `/fsr/choose-flights?...&sc=7,7` | Homepage form submit | Fires `CalendarPricing` (prime) + first `FetchSSENestedFlights` (outbound search). Cart is born in the meta event of the search. |
| 2 | click outbound fare → Basic toggle → Select | User click | POST `/api/flight/NestedCabinEntitlements` (prefetch), then POST `/api/flight/RegisterFlights` with `TripIndex:1`. URL transitions to `idx=2`. |
| 3 | `/fsr/choose-flights?...&idx=2&cartId=...` | Auto-nav from idx=1 select | Second `FetchSSENestedFlights` with `SearchTypeSelection:3` + empty Trips — server picks the return slice from cart context. |
| 4 | click return fare → Select | User click | POST `/api/flight/RegisterFlights` with `TripIndex:2`. URL transitions to `/traveler/choose-travelers?cartId=...&tqp=R`. |
| 5 | `/traveler/choose-travelers?cartId=...` | Auto-nav after 2nd Register | The SPA pre-fills traveler name/DOB/contact from `/xapi/myunited/User/profile`. Continue button submits `/api/ShoppingCart/RegisterTravelers`. Response includes full `DisplayCart` with `SearchType:2`, `GrandTotal`, both `DisplayTrips[]`. |
| 6 | `/book-flight/customizetravel/<cartId>?tqp=R` | Auto-nav after RegisterTravelers | "Travel add-ons" page — 3 bundle offers per slice. On Basic Economy you want to decline; the button is labeled **"Continue to seats"** (not "Skip" or similar). |
| 7 | `/book-flight/seatmap/<cartId>?tqp=R` | Auto-nav after bundles | Seat picker. For Basic Economy, seats are paid-only or skip. Skip proceeds to payment. |
| 8 | `/book-flight/payment/<cartId>?tqp=R` (next) | Seatmap next | Payment page. NOT YET CAPTURED. |
| 9 | POST `/api/ShoppingCart/checkout` (suspected) | Payment submit | NOT YET CAPTURED. |

### Critical UI selectors (for future CDP drive)

All validated 2026-04-23:

- **Homepage round-trip radio**: `input[name=flightType][value=roundTrip]` (pre-selected by default)
- **Datepicker React fiber trick**: walk fiber up from `#DepartDate` until you find a fiber whose `memoizedProps` has both `setDepart` and `setReturn` — call with native `Date` objects. Displays populate but form validation rejects the state, so prefer calendar clicks.
- **Calendar day cells**: inside `<table aria-label="April 2026">` etc. Cells past today have `aria-label=null` and text like `"28\n$373"`. `.click()` works.
- **Find flights submit**: `button[aria-label="Find flights"]` — after calendar clicks the state is valid, submit works.
- **Fare panel "From $XXX" button** for a flight: walk up from a text-node matching `^UA\s*<num>\s` until you find an ancestor with >3 buttons, then find `b.innerText.replace(/\s+/g,'') === 'From$XXX'`.
- **"Basic Economy works for me" toggle**: `label[aria-label="Basic Economy works for me."]` — required before the Basic Select button enables.
- **Basic Select button**: `button[aria-label="Select United Economy Basic (Most restrictive)"]`.
- **Round-trip return select**: only the first Basic select panel has the works-for-me toggle; on return slice it may be auto-enabled (seen once).
- **Continue (traveler page)**: `button[type=submit]` with text "Continue" whose ancestor is `#parentCommonShoppingCartContainer`. **`.click()` and real `Input.dispatchMouseEvent` BOTH failed to advance the page when we were RE-landing on the traveler page post-RegisterTravelers** — cart was already past that step server-side. Solution: navigate directly to `/book-flight/customizetravel/<cartId>?tqp=R`.
- **"Continue to seats"**: on customize-travel page. Plain `.click()` may or may not work; real `Input.dispatchMouseEvent` at element coords works reliably.

### Cart lifecycle observations

- Multiple carts can coexist per session. Each successful RegisterFlights
  on a fresh search mints a new cartId. Old carts idle until they expire
  (~5–15 min of inactivity observed; requirements.md:910 mentions ~5min
  but we held `76695CE3` for ~30min and it was still alive).
- `LoadReservationAndCart` returning the "connection issues" error ≠
  cart dead — it can mean the cart is missing query params OR the
  request needs a Referer. Dead-cart is a different response.
- `/traveler/` page sends `/api/auth/signout` if the user sits idle on
  it — that's what kills sessions, not the cart itself.

### Resume behavior

Re-navigating to `/traveler/choose-travelers?cartId=<cartId>` on a cart
that's already past RegisterTravelers simply re-renders the traveler
page with pre-filled data but **does not re-submit**. The Continue
button on re-landing does nothing because the cart state is already
past that step. To advance, navigate directly to the next page's URL
(`/book-flight/customizetravel/<cartId>`).

### Skip-the-browser hybrid (actually shipping)

Given the `SearchType:2` mystery, the realistic shape for a
pure-Python booking is:

1. `prepare_round_trip_cart(origin, dest, depart, return_date)` — uses
   CDP to drive the SPA homepage→choose-flights to create a round-trip
   cart. Returns the cart_id.
2. Everything else via pure HTTP:
   - `search_flights(cart_id=..., trip_index=1)` — get outbound offers for the active cart
   - `select_flight(..., trip_index=1)` — commit outbound
   - `search_flights(cart_id=..., trip_index=2)` — get return offers (type-3 body)
   - `select_flight(..., trip_index=2)` — commit return
   - `register_traveler(cart_id=...)`
   - `get_cart(cart_id=...)` — snapshot anytime
   - `continue_to_bundles(cart_id=...)` — no-op on our end (server auto-advances)
   - `skip_bundles(cart_id=...)` — call whatever endpoint the "Continue to seats" button fires. TODO capture.
   - `skip_seats(cart_id=...)` — call whatever endpoint the seatmap "skip" button fires. TODO capture.
   - `submit_payment(cart_id=..., payment_method_id=...)` — the final `POST /api/ShoppingCart/checkout`. TODO capture body.

Until those TODOs are captured, driving the last 2-3 clicks via CDP is
the pragmatic path. That's what we did this session.

## Session 2 discoveries (2026-04-23 evening)

### Full checkout page capture

Drove cart `76695CE3-015A-46F7-84DD-AFF523E427F3` end-to-end:
`/traveler/` → `/book-flight/customizetravel/<cartId>?tqp=R`
→ `/book-flight/seatmap/<cartId>?tqp=R` → `/book-flight/checkout/<cartId>?tqp=R`.

**Page-advance buttons** (verified working via `Input.dispatchMouseEvent`
at element coordinates; plain `.click()` sometimes fails when the button
isn't in a form):

| Page | Button text | Button aria / selector | Fires |
|---|---|---|---|
| `/traveler/` | "Continue" | `button[type=submit]` inside `#parentCommonShoppingCartContainer` | `/api/ShoppingCart/RegisterTravelers` (already captured) |
| `/customizetravel/` | "Continue to seats" | `button[type=submit]` matching innerText | Auto-advance to `/seatmap/` (no new backend call observed on skip) |
| `/seatmap/` | "Continue to checkout" | `button` matching innerText | Auto-advance to `/checkout/` |
| `/checkout/` | "Agree and purchase" | `button` containing `<span>Agree and purchase</span>` | **NOT YET CAPTURED** — POSTs to the final charge endpoint |

**Critical on checkout page**: after clicking Purchase, the insurance
offer appears **in-page** (not a new page). Must select "No, I will
not travel without this insurance" + click Next to unblock the
Purchase button. Joe clicked it live; the resolved state persists.

### Saved cards endpoint

**`GET /api/user/creditCards`** returns all saved cards on the
logged-in account. PCI-safe: last4, BIN, expiry, IATA 2-char code
(AX/VI/MC/DS/DC/TP/JC/UP), opaque handles. No PAN or CVV ever.

Captured shape (one card):
```json
{
  "CustomerId": 53955798,
  "CCTypeDescription": "American Express",
  "CustomDescription": "AMEX Platinum",
  "Code": "AX",
  "ExpMonth": 12, "ExpYear": 2027,
  "AccountNumberLastFourDigits": "1007",
  "AccountNumberMasked": "American Express  **1007",
  "PersistentToken": "473009498861007",
  "AccountNumberToken": "a66ced2d-1749-4b03-9326-e005a9bfe0a0",
  "Key": "0ATu79Wy0J4wgmp2iAaMYpAdnpVTDCVosnsOpFCVaMRFmV96+W2AOt+SLGMWhjklZ3Gu3McsCIA0CVO7u3ZnXs4cr/zkDNCsP9xIctZpc6s=",
  "AddressKey": "...",
  "ExpirationDate": "12/31/2027",
  "Payor": {"GivenName": "Giuseppe Contini"},
  "IsDefault": false, "IsPrimary": false, "IsSelected": false
}
```

Three cards on Joe's account:
- **2005** — American Express (no custom description) — currently default-selected on checkout
- **1007** — American Express (custom name "AMEX Platinum")
- **9768** — MasterCard (custom name "AncestryPass Debit")

Three opaque handles per card that thread into the checkout POST:
`Key`, `AccountNumberToken`, `PersistentToken`. Skill stores all three
in `payment_method.providerTokens`.

### Eligible forms of payment endpoint

**`POST /api/payment/GetEligibleFOP`** returns the payment method
TYPES eligible for a specific cart (VI, MC, AX, DS, DC, TP, JC, UP,
MPVI, PP, PZ, AP, TC). Request body mirrors the cart + passenger
shape. Response lists per-type rules: SortOrder, ForceReserveHours,
HoldTimeHours, TimeToLive. Doesn't pick the actual card — that's
still in the cart's selected-card state.

**`POST /api/FlexPricer/CalendarPricing`** — prime call fired from
homepage when dates are picked. Body carries `IsOneway: false` +
Depart/Return dates. Wired into `search_flights` when `return_date`
is set. Doesn't flip SearchType on its own (tested) but matches the
SPA's call chain.

**`POST /api/Payment/GetTermsAndConditions`** — checkout T&C text.
**`POST /api/Payment/GetCreditsFromSession`** — travel credits on account.
**`POST /api/Payment/IsPartnerProvisionEnabled`** — Chase/partner flags.
**`POST /api/Products/OfferDetail`** — bundle offer detail.
**`POST /api/CCEProducts/Coupons/get-coupon-popup`** — coupons popup.
**`POST /api/ShoppingCart/RegisterLoyaltyCertificate`** — apply LCR.
**`GET /api/user/creditCards`** — saved cards list (see above).
**`GET /api/user/addresses`** — saved addresses (billing + shipping).
**`GET /api/user/emailAddresses`** — saved emails.
**`GET /api/user/phoneNumbers`** — saved phones.
**`GET /api/User/AccountStatus`** — account posture / eligibility.
**`GET /api/User/PublicKeyNonPCI`** — RSA public key for non-PCI field encryption.

### Redux store on the checkout page

The SPA keeps a Redux store accessible via any child fiber:
```js
const dep = document.getElementById('DepartDate');  // or any component
const fiberKey = Object.keys(dep).find(k => k.startsWith('__reactFiber'));
let cur = dep[fiberKey];
while (cur && !(cur.memoizedProps && cur.memoizedProps.store && cur.memoizedProps.store.getState)) cur = cur.return;
window.__uaStore__ = cur.memoizedProps.store;
// Later:
const state = __uaStore__.getState();
const cp = state.commonpayment;  // all selected payment state
```

`commonpayment` slice top-level keys:
- `autoRenew`, `billingAddress1/2/3`, `city`, `state`, `zipCode`, `country`, `countryCode`
- `phoneNumber`, `email`
- `cardInfo` (always empty when a saved card is selected)
- `savedCard` (the full selected card object with `id`, `key`, `lastFourDigits`, etc.)
- `savedEmailAddress`, `savedBillingAddress`, `savedPhoneNumber` (each with full provider keys)
- `taxIdType`, `taxIdNumber`, `taxIdHolder`, `chaseDifferentCard`
- `spouseMPNumber`, `idType`, `idNumber`

### Rich tax breakdown location

`Data.CartData.DisplayCart.DisplayPrices[0].SubItems[]` — each entry
has `Key` (0-based index), `Description`, `Amount`. Verified 8 items
for a domestic round-trip totaling $61.05:

| # | Description | Amount | Binding |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | U.S. Transportation Tax | $13.54 | outbound segment |
| 1 | U.S. Transportation Tax | $16.71 | return segment |
| 2 | U.S. Passenger Facility Charge | $4.50 | origin airport (AUS) |
| 3 | U.S. Flight Segment Tax | $5.30 | outbound |
| 4 | Passenger Civil Aviation Security Service Fee | $5.60 | outbound |
| 5 | U.S. Passenger Facility Charge | $4.50 | origin airport (SFO) |
| 6 | U.S. Flight Segment Tax | $5.30 | return |
| 7 | Passenger Civil Aviation Security Service Fee | $5.60 | return |

### Short CartRefId

The human-friendly cart ID shown on the page ("Cart ID: 641457887")
lives at `Data.CartData.CartRefId`. NOT the same as the long UUID
`DisplayCart.CartId` — both are returned in every LoadReservationAndCart
response. Surface both; users remember the short one.

### Aircraft / airport enrichment

Every DisplayTrips[].Flights[] entry has:
- `EquipmentDisclosures.EquipmentType` (IATA 3-char: "738", "7M8")
- `EquipmentDisclosures.EquipmentDescription` ("Boeing 737-800")
- `OriginDescription` ("Austin, TX, US (AUS)")
- `OriginCountryCode`, `OriginStateCode`, `OrgTimezoneOffset`
- Same for `Destination*` fields

Skill now parses these into proper `aircraft` (with `manufacturer:
organization`) and `airport` (with city, countryCode, region) nodes.
Manufacturer lookup table is IATA equipment code → organization node;
only populated for codes actually observed to avoid fabricating data.

### Captured files for future reference

- `/tmp/checkout-intercept.json` — full Network capture of checkout
  page load + seat page + customize-travel page (89 requests)
- `/tmp/rt-intercept.json` — earlier one-way intercept for comparison
- `/tmp/rt3-intercept.json` — round-trip homepage form drive (partial)

## Booking confirmation gate (new in session 2)

`prepare_booking(cart_id)` and `confirm_booking(blob, confirm_amount,
payment_method_last4, dry_run=True)` implement a two-step commit.
See the docstrings in `united.py` for the full contract.

**HMAC key persistence**: the signing key lives at
`~/.agentos/united-booking-key` (atomic write, 0o600 perms). First
call mints it; subsequent calls reuse. `skill_secret.get/set` is
attempted first but doesn't always persist across invocations, so
the file is the authoritative store.

**Gates enforced by `confirm_booking`**:
1. Blob signature verifies (HMAC-SHA256 with persisted key)
2. Blob not expired (5 min TTL)
3. `confirm_amount` EXACT string match to blob total ("USD 464.36")
4. Live cart total hasn't drifted since prepare_booking
5. `payment_method_last4` matches a card from `/api/user/creditCards`
6. `dry_run` must be explicitly `False`

Current state: **all gates verified working via dry_run tests**.
Real checkout POST body shape is not yet captured, so `dry_run=False`
raises RuntimeError rather than guess.

## Session 3 starting state (pick-up checklist)

### What's shipped and tested
- Round-trip booking flow works end-to-end via SPA drive (homepage form
  → Find flights → outbound select → return select → traveler → customize
  → seatmap → checkout) with cart `76695CE3-015A-46F7-84DD-AFF523E427F3`
  kept alive for ~45min, SearchType=2, GrandTotal $464.36.
- `get_cart(cart_id)` works pure-Python (with the correct query params)
- `select_flight` supports round-trip Referer + trip_index
- `search_flights` supports CalendarPricing prime + type-3 return-slice body
- `register_traveler` works on round-trip carts
- `get_seatmap` + `render_seatmap` work on both legs
- `prepare_booking` returns rich `booking_offer` node with itinerary,
  fares, tax_lines, payment_method, signed blob — **depends on a live
  authenticated session**
- `confirm_booking` gates all verified via dry_run

### What's still open
1. **United login is no longer active** — first task of session 3 is
   to re-authenticate. Either: (a) Joe logs in on Brave manually, then
   `store_session_cookies` refreshes credentials, or (b) write a
   proper `login(cdp_port=9222)` tool that opens a CDP-driven sign-in
   flow. The skill has stubs that mention this but the tool isn't
   actually implemented yet.
2. **Capture the final checkout POST body shape.** The endpoint is
   suspected to be `/api/ShoppingCart/checkout` or similar. Options:
   - (A) Drive Agree-and-Purchase for real with intercept — books
     the flight ($464.36) and learns the shape; or
   - (B) CDP `Fetch.enable` scoped to checkout URLs + abort after
     capture — learns shape without booking. Script stub written at
     `/tmp/ua_pause_checkout.py` last session.
3. **Wire the checkout POST into `confirm_booking` dry_run=False path**
   once body shape is known.
4. **Seat selection**: Joe wants to be able to pick an aisle seat.
   `/book-flight/seatmap/<cartId>` URL and `register_seats` tool
   already exist. Need a skill tool to go back to seatmap from
   checkout page (just nav + click logic).
5. **`clear_cart`** — not yet captured. Click "Start Over" in UI with
   intercept running.
6. **`search_flights` pure-Python round-trip mystery**: even with
   CalendarPricing prime + `sc=7,7` Referer + type-3 body, carts
   born via pure HTTP end up SearchType=1. Must CDP-drive the
   homepage form once to mint a SearchType=2 cart. Unsolved.
7. **Skill performance**: every tool call mints a fresh bearer via
   `/api/auth/anonymous-token` and re-fetches profile. Cache both
   per-invocation (Joe flagged the 4s latency as annoying).

## Sign-in flow — reverse-engineered (2026-04-24, session 3)

The login UI is a React drawer (`[role=dialog][aria-modal=true]`),
**not** a standalone page. The URL `/en/us/account/sign-in` is a
404; the drawer is triggered by clicking `#loginButton` on any
united.com page. This means `login` cannot deep-link to a URL —
it must drive the homepage → click loginButton → interact with the
drawer.

### Drawer architecture — "Ciam" components

The drawer's class names are prefixed `app-components-Ciam-*`
(Customer Identity and Access Management). Main sub-components:

- `Ciam-styles__containerEmbedded` — drawer body
- `Ciam-LoginButton-loginButton` — the homepage header button that opens the drawer
- `Ciam-ValidateOTP-styles__wfull` — OTP step's Continue button

### Identifier-first, then password

| Step | Selector | Field | Fires |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `#MPIDEmailField` | Email OR MP# | `POST /xapi/auth/validate-username` |
| 2 (if MP#) | `#password` | Password | `POST /xapi/auth/signin` (202 + default OTP auto-send) |
| 2a (optional) | `button "try a different way"` | — | — (pure client state) |
| 2b (optional) | `input[type=radio][value=Phone|Email|Voice|Totp]` + Continue | MFA method | `POST /xapi/auth/send-otp  {mfaChannelType: "Email"|"Phone"|"Voice"|...}` |
| 3 | 6 `input.atm-c-otp-input` + Continue | OTP | `POST /xapi/auth/validate-otp  {mfaChannelType, otp, isRememberDevice}` |
| 3a (optional) | `label "Don't require verification code again"` checkbox | Remember this browser | toggles `isRememberDevice` in step 3 body |

**Email vs MP#**: United's CIAM accepts both, but its back-end
table-lookups by MP#. If the email isn't the one primarily linked
to the MileagePlus account, step 1 returns:

```json
POST /xapi/auth/validate-username  { "userName": "anthropic@contini.co" }
→ 200 { "status":200, "data": { "isValid": false, "multipleAccountFound": false, "errorCode": "LOGIN_WITH_MP" } }
```

`errorCode: "LOGIN_WITH_MP"` is the explicit signal "use your MP#
instead." For Joe (XX118941), going direct with the MP# is correct.

Successful validate-username returns:

```json
POST /xapi/auth/validate-username  { "userName": "XX118941" }
→ 200 {
    "status": 200,
    "data": {
      "isValid": true,
      "multipleAccountFound": false,
      "userName": "*****941",                              // masked for display
      "encryptedUserName": "DAAAAEla+BeBZpyMcs20jB..."     // opaque token, threads into signin
    }
  }
```

### Signin POST + MFA trigger

```
POST /xapi/auth/signin
Referer: https://www.united.com/en/us/account/sign-in
X-Authorization-api: bearer <anonymous-token>
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "username": "DAAAAEla+BeBZpyMcs20jB...",   // encryptedUserName from step 1
  "password": "<cleartext>",
  "toPersist": false                          // "Remember me" (false by default)
}

→ 202 Accepted  {
  "status": 202,
  "data": {
    "token": {
      "hash": "DAAAAPfKW+o2hTaciCu...",
      "expiresAt": "2026-04-24T13:55:15.0000000+00:00"
    },
    "encryptedUserName": "DAAAAGPF5Q6GlQ2wG...",   // ROTATED — use this from here on
    "mfa": {
      "type": "OTP",
      "default": "Phone",
      "email": "u****d@contini.co",
      "phone": "******3195",
      "voice": "******3195",
      "totp": "unitedapp"
    }
  }
}
```

- HTTP 202 ("Accepted") is the happy-path signal — "creds OK, now
  MFA." 200 would mean authenticated-no-MFA (not yet observed for
  this account).
- `token.hash` is the bearer to use for subsequent MFA-step calls.
- `encryptedUserName` is rotated — re-read it from each response.
- `mfa.*` keys list available methods (masked for display).

### MFA method selection

If the default (Phone/text) is fine, the SMS auto-dispatches with
the 202 and the UI shows the 6-digit code inputs directly. If you
want a different method, click **"try a different way"** (pure
client-side state change, no XHR) → radios appear with `value`:

| Label | Radio value | Delivery |
|---|---|---|
| Text: ******3195 | `Phone` | SMS to phone on file |
| Email: u****d@contini.co | `Email` | Email to address on file |
| Voice call: ******3195 | `Voice` | Automated phone call |
| United app | `Totp` | UnitedApp TOTP code |

Click the radio → click Continue → server fires the delivery (TBD
capture). For Joe, SMS arrived on the first 202 without any
follow-up click; the second-click flow was only needed after
error.

### Observed error mode: "Verification code not sent"

**Symptom**: after clicking "try a different way" → selecting Text
→ Continue, modal shows `Verification code not sent. Try again.`
but **no XHR fires**.

**Root cause hypothesis**: the `token.hash` from the signin 202 is
single-use. On the first 202 it carries an implicit "send SMS to
default method" action. Once consumed (either by the auto-send or
by a Resend attempt within the client-side rate-limit window),
subsequent triggers need a fresh signin — but the UI doesn't
re-enable the password field.

**Workaround**: if you see "Verification code not sent", kill the
drawer (close via the X button) and restart the identifier +
password sequence. The fresh 202 will send SMS automatically.

Also: the UI shows `"Wait 1 minute before requesting a new code."`
as an informational banner after any OTP send — this is a pure
client-side countdown, not a server-side block.

### Gotchas (CDP driving)

- `form.requestSubmit()` beats `button.click()` for React
  submit-type buttons. A plain `.click()` often short-circuits
  without firing the form's submit event (and thus no XHR).
- React controlled inputs: set the value via the prototype's
  native setter, then dispatch `input` + `change` events. The
  "type into field" pattern from other skills applies here.
- `#loginButton` is always in the DOM on any united.com page
  (header navbar). To open the sign-in drawer from any URL, click
  it rather than navigating to `/en/us/account/sign-in` (which is
  a 404).
- The drawer sits **atop** the homepage — keep the underlying tab
  on `https://www.united.com/en/us` so the drawer renders
  correctly. Deep-linking to any other page also opens the drawer
  successfully but leaves "Page not found" or whatever behind it.

### Captured: `POST /xapi/auth/send-otp`  (MFA channel selection)

Fires when the user clicks "try a different way" → picks a
non-default method → Continue. Body carries just the channel type;
the server looks up recipient from the profile attached to the
signin-token on the session.

```json
POST /xapi/auth/send-otp
Referer: https://www.united.com/en/us
X-Authorization-api: bearer <signin-token>
Content-Type: application/json

{ "mfaChannelType": "Email" }    // or "Phone" | "Voice" | "Totp"

→ 200 {
    "status": 200,
    "data": {
      "mfa": {
        "type": "OTP", "default": "Email",          // rotated to match request
        "email": "u****d@contini.co",
        "phone": "********3195",
        "voice": "********3195",
        "totp": "unitedapp"
      },
      "status": "Success"
    }
  }
```

### Captured: `POST /xapi/auth/validate-otp`  (final auth)

```json
POST /xapi/auth/validate-otp
Referer: https://www.united.com/en/us
X-Authorization-api: bearer <signin-token>
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "mfaChannelType": "email",          // LOWERCASE here — note divergence from send-otp
  "otp": "345318",
  "isRememberDevice": false
}

→ 200 {
    "status": 200,
    "data": {
      "token": {
        "hash": "DAAAAC2s0XKi50zM6...",
        "expiresAt": "2026-04-24T16:21:18.0000000+00:00"
      },
      "encryptedUserName": "DAAAADB9x3Ri5U...",     // rotated again
      "profile": {
        "CustomerId": 53955798,
        "ProfileId": 19218370,
        "ProfileOwnerId": 53955798,
        "Travelers": [ ... ]
        // full profile block; session cookies (AuthCookie, User,
        // MPSessionID, etc.) are also set via Set-Cookie on this response
      }
    }
  }
```

**Case sensitivity gotcha:** `send-otp` takes `Email`/`Phone`/…
(TitleCase); `validate-otp` takes `email`/`phone`/… (lowercase).
Normalize both.

**`isRememberDevice: true`** — toggling the "Don't require
verification code again" checkbox in the OTP step flips this bool
in the validate-otp body. Not captured yet, but worth clicking on
every successful login: sessions last longer and re-auth skips
OTP on the same device. Add as an argument to `verify_login_code`
(default `True` for autonomous use; bias toward the long-lived
state). Need a follow-up capture of a `{isRememberDevice: true}`
response to confirm whether it sets a different cookie or just
extends `User.RememberID` TTL.

### Open items (still need capture)

1. **`toPersist: true`** at `/xapi/auth/signin` — the pre-OTP
   remember-me toggle. Same question: different cookie or
   extended TTL?
2. **TOTP (`value: "Totp"`) flow** — does the UI pop a 6-digit
   code input for UnitedApp, or redirect to a deep-link?
3. **`validate-otp` with `isRememberDevice: true`** — which
   cookie changes.

### Pure-Python implementation plan (login tools)

Captured shapes are enough to build three skill tools, matching
the canonical [`skills/adding-login.md` multi-step OTP
pattern](../../../docs/src/content/docs/skills/adding-login.md):

```python
# 1) Produces credentials on a public connection.
@connection("public")
async def login(*, method: str = "email", remember: bool = True,
                **params) -> dict:
    """Kick off sign-in + send an OTP via the chosen channel.

    method: "email" | "phone" | "voice" | "totp"
    remember: toggles isRememberDevice on validate-otp later

    Returns a `hint` telling the agent to poll Gmail (or
    iMessage / phone) for the 6-digit code and then call
    verify_login_code.
    """
    creds = await credentials.retrieve(
        domain="united.com", required=["email", "password"])
    if not creds.get("found"):
        return skill_error("NeedsCredentials",
                           required=["email", "password"])
    identifier = creds["value"]["email"]     # MP# or email
    password   = creds["value"]["password"]

    # Step 1: validate-username
    v = await http.post(
        "https://www.united.com/xapi/auth/validate-username",
        json={"userName": identifier},
        headers={"X-Authorization-api": f"bearer {await _anon_bearer()}"})
    if not v["data"]["isValid"]:
        return skill_error("InvalidIdentifier",
                           hint=v["data"].get("errorCode"))
    encrypted_un = v["data"]["encryptedUserName"]

    # Step 2: signin (202 + default OTP auto-send)
    s = await http.post(
        "https://www.united.com/xapi/auth/signin",
        json={"username": encrypted_un, "password": password,
              "toPersist": False},
        headers={"X-Authorization-api": f"bearer {await _anon_bearer()}"})
    assert s["status"] == 202
    signin_token = s["data"]["token"]["hash"]

    # Step 3 (only if method != default): POST send-otp
    if method and method.lower() != s["data"]["mfa"]["default"].lower():
        await http.post(
            "https://www.united.com/xapi/auth/send-otp",
            json={"mfaChannelType": method.title()},   # "Email", "Phone", ...

```

Notes:
- `_anon_bearer()` — United hands out an anonymous bearer to any
  browser on page load. Reuse the helper already used by the skill
  elsewhere (see `_ensure_bearer` in `united.py`).
- `_stash_pending_login` / `_pop_pending_login` — keep a single
  row in a skill-scoped table or reuse the HMAC-signed-blob
  pattern we built for booking confirmation. 5-min TTL matches
  OTP expiry exactly.
- Agents using the skill will usually chain
  `login(method="email") → gmail.search_emails → verify_login_code(code)`
  — we can also ship a convenience `login_and_verify()` that
  polls Gmail internally with the proven extraction pattern, for
  the common case.


## CDP drive lessons (session 3, 2026-04-24)

- **Dual-client Network.enable race.** Two separate Python
  processes both `Network.enable`ing the same page target produces
  silent event loss — only one session gets events. Fix: unified
  single-process driver (`/tmp/ua_flow.py`) that does capture +
  commands on one WS.
- **`Storage.clearDataForOrigin`** fails at browser-level target
  (`Internal error`). Use `Network.getCookies` + `Network.deleteCookies`
  at a page-level target instead, or CDP to a specific tab's
  Network domain.
- **Fresh tab = fresh Akamai signal.** After clearing cookies and
  opening a new tab, the identifier-first flow fired a clean 202
  signin response with SMS auto-dispatch. The "Verification code
  not sent" error on a re-used session didn't reproduce on a
  fresh one.
- **`#loginButton` is in the DOM on every united.com page** — no
  reason to navigate to any specific URL before opening the login
  drawer.

### Sign-in round-trip — proven drive pattern (session 3, 2026-04-24)

End-to-end drive that restored the logged-in state:

```
1. Close drawer + Network.deleteCookies(united.com)  → 0 cookies
2. Page.reload(ignoreCache=true)                     → clean DOM
3. Click #loginButton                                → drawer opens
4. Fill #MPIDEmailField with MP# + form.requestSubmit()
   → POST /xapi/auth/validate-username  200 (isValid + encryptedUserName)
5. Fill #password + form.requestSubmit()
   → POST /xapi/auth/signin  202 (token.hash + mfa.default)
6. Click "try a different way"                        → pure client state
7. Click radio[value=Email] + click Continue
   → POST /xapi/auth/send-otp {mfaChannelType:"Email"}  200
8. Poll Gmail for new email via agentos gmail.search_emails
   query='from:united.com subject:"verification code" newer_than:1h'
   → age-check < 270s; regex \b(\d{6})\b from snippet
9. clear_otp (focus last box + 8× Backspace via Input.dispatchKeyEvent)
10. type_otp CODE (focus first box + Input.insertText per digit)
11. [pause — human verifies readback matches visually]
12. submit_otp CODE (readback guard + banner guard → click Continue)
    → POST /xapi/auth/validate-otp {mfaChannelType:"email", otp, isRememberDevice}  200
    → Set-Cookie: AuthCookie, User, MPSessionID, SID
13. check_session → united:XX118941 isActive:true
```

Zero bad OTP submits. Zero lockouts. Full XHR capture in
`/tmp/ua_flow_capture.json`. The Python skill can replay steps
4,5,7,12 directly via `http.post` — no browser needed once
`_anon_bearer` is obtained.

### OTP box handling — proven pattern (session 3, 2026-04-24)

The 6-box segmented OTP widget (`input.atm-c-otp-input`) does NOT
respect the React native-setter trick. Setting `.value = ''` +
dispatching `input` events across the 6 boxes leaves the widget's
internal state holding the old digits — the next submit sends the
stale code and the server invalidates the token.

**What works (empirically verified):**

Clear:
```python
# Focus box 5 (last), then Backspace 8 times via CDP Input domain
await evaljs("const ins = document.querySelectorAll("
             "'[role=dialog] input.atm-c-otp-input'); "
             "if (ins[5]) ins[5].focus();")
for _ in range(8):
    await cdp.call("Input.dispatchKeyEvent", {
        "type": "keyDown", "key": "Backspace",
        "code": "Backspace", "windowsVirtualKeyCode": 8})
    await cdp.call("Input.dispatchKeyEvent", {
        "type": "keyUp", "key": "Backspace",
        "code": "Backspace", "windowsVirtualKeyCode": 8})
    await asyncio.sleep(0.05)
```

Type:
```python
# Focus box 0, then Input.insertText per digit — one at a time
await evaljs("const ins = document.querySelectorAll("
             "'[role=dialog] input.atm-c-otp-input'); "
             "if (ins[0]) ins[0].focus();")
for ch in code:
    await cdp.call("Input.insertText", {"text": ch})
    await asyncio.sleep(0.08)
```

**Readback before submit is mandatory:**
```python
values = await evaljs("Array.from(document.querySelectorAll("
    "'[role=dialog] input.atm-c-otp-input')).map(i => i.value)")
assert ''.join(values) == code
banner = await evaljs("(document.querySelector('[role=alert]')"
    "||{}).innerText")
assert not banner or 'not sent' not in banner.lower()
```

Each wrong submit kills the signin token and forces a full restart
(clear cookies → fresh identifier + password → new OTP). A single
bad click is expensive; fail the submit path closed if readback
doesn't match.

**What doesn't work on this widget:**
- `el.value = ''` + synthetic `input`/`change` events (React's
  widget state survives).
- `Cmd+A` + `Backspace` per box — multi-box backspace handler
  interferes with per-box selection, leaves a ragged state like
  `['9','2','4','','','']`.
- Clearing and typing in the same `Runtime.evaluate` call — React
  batches the updates and merges them, rejecting the new code.

### Gmail OTP extraction — proven pattern (session 3, 2026-04-24)

Sender: `notifications@united.com` (or `*@united.com` — tolerate
both). Subject: `Here's your verification code`. TTL: **5 minutes**
from arrival. Body includes a single 6-digit number.

```python
r = await run({
    "skill": "gmail",
    "tool": "search_emails",
    "params": {
        "query": ("from:united.com "
                  "subject:\"verification code\" "
                  "newer_than:10m"),
        "limit": 3,
    },
})
# Response shape: r["__trace__"][1].attributes.body_preview OR
# call gmail.get_email for full body.
emails = sorted(r["emails"], key=lambda e: e["published"], reverse=True)
latest = emails[0]
# Parse: exactly one 6-digit group appears in the body
m = re.search(r"\b(\d{6})\b", latest["body"] or latest["body_preview"])
if not m:
    raise RuntimeError(f"no 6-digit code found: {latest['body_preview']!r}")
code = m.group(1)
# Validate freshness — code expires in 5 min
age_sec = (datetime.utcnow() - latest["published_dt"]).total_seconds()
if age_sec > 270:  # 4.5 min to leave buffer
    raise RuntimeError(f"code is {age_sec:.0f}s old — request a new one")
```

Edge cases observed:
- If `search_emails` returns the email body as empty string,
  call `get_email` on the id and inspect `__trace__` for
  `body_preview`. United's HTML emails sometimes don't fall back
  to plain-text cleanly through the Gmail API.
- If two "Here's your verification code" emails arrive minutes
  apart (because an early request "failed silently"), **always
  pick the newest one**. The older code is invalidated by the
  new send.
- `newer_than:10m` scopes the query cheaply; don't pull the
  whole inbox.


## Cart lifecycle — observed behavior (session 4, 2026-04-24)

United's shopping cart does **not** follow the ecommerce idle-timeout
pattern our earlier notes assumed. Sessions 1–3 said "cart expires
after ~5 min idle"; that's wrong for the case below. The actual rules,
as observed, are more permissive and worth documenting in full so
future agents don't waste time minting fresh carts when an existing
one will do.

### The zombie cart

**Setup:** a round-trip cart was created via
`/api/flight/FetchSSENestedFlights` ~30 min before this session
started. Outbound had been searched (not committed — no RegisterFlights
POST). Return-slice search against that cart id returned 0 offers.
The Brave tab was left parked on
`/fsr/choose-flights?tripIndex=2&idx=1&cartId=<id>`.

**Observed after 30 min idle:**
- `GET /api/ShoppingCart/LoadReservationAndCart?cartId=<id>` → **200**.
  Cart is fully readable — returns DisplayCart with 0 committed flights
  ("GrandTotal" reflects the last *searched* product, not a held one).
- `Page.reload(ignoreCache=true)` on the parked URL → SPA re-renders
  the outbound list (tripIndex=1 view) **despite** the URL saying
  `tripIndex=2&idx=1`. Four UA nonstops rendered, round-trip totals
  ($373 Basic / $473 Economy / $716 Economy Plus / $1,293 First).
- The cart's round-trip context (AUS→SFO 04-28/05-03) survived the
  reload. No re-priming needed. No fresh `FetchSSENestedFlights` call
  fired — the SPA hydrated from server-side session state.
- The `E7E92E27-BDEB-4B4D-A331-9FF7950C3F10` cart used here was
  ~30 min old at first hit and still live. Upper bound unknown; this
  is the data point we have.

### What this means for the skill

- **Don't mint a fresh cart just because the last action was a while
  ago.** A round-trip cart with no committed flights appears to live
  for at least ~30 min of idle, possibly longer.
- **URL-state vs SPA-state mismatch is normal.** A URL showing
  `tripIndex=2` does not guarantee the return-slice picker is
  rendered; the SPA decides which slice to show based on cart state
  (what's committed vs what's still searchable). Read the rendered
  DOM, not the URL.
- **A reload is cheap and safe on a zombie cart.** If the page shows
  no flight rows (`document.querySelectorAll('span')` finds no
  `UA \d+ \(` spans), `Page.reload(ignoreCache=true)` is the first
  thing to try — it re-seeds the SPA from the cart's server-side
  state without a fresh search.
- **Pure-Python return-slice search still fails on a zombie cart.**
  Last session captured this: `{SearchTypeSelection: 3, Trips: []}`
  with `cart_id` + `trip_index=2` returns 0 offers, because the
  priming POST that fires on `trip_index=1 + return_date + no
  cart_id` doesn't stick across the cart. The CDP workaround is
  still required for minting a round-trip cart from scratch — but
  not for resuming an existing one.

### Rule of thumb

> When an agent resumes work on a United cart, the first question is
> "does this cart already hold the thing I want?" — not "is this
> cart still alive?". Alive is the default; held state is what
> matters. `get_cart` tells you what's held; the SPA at
> `/fsr/choose-flights?cartId=<id>` tells you what's still searchable
> on the same cart.

### Cart states, observed so far

| State | How to recognize | Valid actions |
|---|---|---|
| **empty round-trip cart** | GrandTotal = 0 or reflects a searched (not held) fare; DisplayTrips is empty | outbound search re-render on reload; pick outbound |
| **outbound-held** | DisplayTrips has 1 entry with TripIndex=1; GrandTotal = outbound price | pick return; `/fsr/choose-flights?tripIndex=2&cartId=<id>` renders return picker |
| **both-held** | DisplayTrips has 2 entries; GrandTotal = full round-trip | `/customizetravel/<id>?tqp=R` renders traveler form |
| **traveler-registered** | DisplayTrips has 2 entries + Travelers array populated | `/checkout/<id>?tqp=R` renders payment |
| **checkout-submitted** | POST to `/api/ShoppingCart/checkout` has succeeded | cart becomes a PNR; no further edits |

Open question: what's the actual TTL on the empty and outbound-held
states? All we know is that empty-round-trip survived 30 min idle.
Worth parking a test: leave a cart idle for 2h, 6h, 24h and see
when `LoadReservationAndCart` starts 404-ing.


## Fare selection mechanics (session 4, 2026-04-24)

Two behaviors the earlier session notes didn't capture, both
observed while committing UA 1336 Basic Economy on the zombie
cart:

### Basic Economy has an acknowledgement checkbox

Clicking the **Basic Economy** fare tile on a flight row opens an
inline drill-down comparing Basic Economy vs the next cabin up
(usually United Economy Standard). The drill-down renders two
`<button aria-label="Select United Economy Basic (Most restrictive)">`
+ `<button aria-label="Select United Economy Standard">` side by
side — but the Basic one is **disabled until a checkbox labeled
"Basic Economy works for me" is ticked**.

The checkbox is a React controlled `<input type=checkbox>`, no form,
no `name`. It sits inside the same drill-down panel as the Select
buttons. A plain CDP mouse click on the checkbox flips it.

**Proven drive pattern:**
```python
# 1. Click the Basic Economy cabin card (x column aligns with the
#    "Basic Economy" column header, not the "$373 United Economy" text).
# 2. Tick the checkbox:
evaljs("""
(() => {
  const lbl = Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('label, span')).find(
    e => /Basic Economy works for me/.test(e.innerText||''));
  let node = lbl, cb = null;
  for (let i = 0; i < 8; i++) {
    node = node.parentElement; if (!node) break;
    cb = node.querySelector('input[type=checkbox]');
    if (cb) break;
  }
  cb.scrollIntoView({block:'center'});
  return JSON.stringify(cb.getBoundingClientRect());
})()
""")
# Click via Input.dispatchMouseEvent at checkbox center.
# 3. Click Select:
evaljs("document.querySelector('button[aria-label=\"Select United Economy Basic (Most restrictive)\"]').click()")
```

`.click()` (plain DOM) works here — no form to `requestSubmit()`.
The earlier note about React buttons needing `requestSubmit()`
applies to form submit buttons, not plain imperative clicks.

### New cart is minted on first fare selection

**Observed**: the zombie cart id (`E7E92E27-...`) was active all
the way through the outbound-picker reload and the fare-tile
drill-down. On clicking **Select Basic Economy** for UA 1336, the
SPA's RegisterFlights POST came back with a **different cart id**
(`0EECAD7A-DB26-4D80-B1F5-220C5F9B2553`) and the URL advanced to
`?tripIndex=2&idx=2&cartId=0EECAD7A...`.

Working theory: United treats a cart as *scoped to a specific
round-trip search session*. Once search results age out of some
internal TTL (or are touched by a new bearer / new session),
committing a fare creates a fresh cart with the selected flight
RegisterFlights'd immediately. The zombie cart is orphaned; its
LoadReservationAndCart still 200s but no further commits can
flow to it.

**What this means:**
- The cart id changes on fare commit when you're resuming an old
  cart. Always **re-read `location.href`** and update your
  `cart_id` state *after* each major commit (RegisterFlights,
  RegisterTravelers, checkout).
- Don't rely on the cart id captured at search time surviving
  across a resume-and-commit. Treat cart id as a
  continuously-rolling value, not a stable booking handle.
- The "stable handle" is the cart id **as of the last successful
  commit**. That's what goes into `prepare_booking`'s signed blob.

### Round-trip total pricing on the outbound page

The outbound-slice cards show **round-trip totals from the cheapest
matching return**, not outbound-only prices. From the banner: *"All
fares shown are the total price roundtrip, per person."* This is
why session 3's captured "$209.41 outbound" total on E7E92E27 looks
so different from session 4's "$373 starting fare" on the same cart
— $209.41 was the one-way-style outbound price because no return
had been paired; $373 is the RT-total pairing UA 1336 outbound with
the cheapest available return (UA 1807 23:59 at $373).

On the return-slice page, each card also shows RT-totals — the
*difference* between rows is the incremental cost of picking that
return slice. Cheapest RT = outbound + cheapest return (same $373).
Premium return slices price as outbound + return-slice delta.


## Browser-state extraction (session 4, 2026-04-24)

**Rule: read page data from browser state, not from HTML. Regex
scraping breaks across languages/currencies and rots with every UI
tweak.** United's SPA persists almost everything in three layers;
here is the exhaustive map for the checkout page.

### Layer 1 — Redux live store (primary source)

United's Redux store is **not** exposed on `window` — it's
attached to a ReactReduxContext provider's `memoizedProps.store`
somewhere inside the React fiber tree. To access it from CDP,
walk the fiber:

```js
function installStore() {
  const roots = Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('div, main, section'));
  for (const el of roots) {
    const fk = Object.keys(el).find(k => k.startsWith('__reactContainer') || k.startsWith('__reactFiber'));
    if (!fk) continue;
    const seen = new Set();
    const stack = [el[fk]];
    while (stack.length) {
      const f = stack.pop();
      if (!f || seen.has(f)) continue;
      seen.add(f);
      const mp = f.memoizedProps;
      if (mp?.store?.getState) { window.__UA_STORE__ = mp.store; return true; }
      if (mp?.value?.store?.getState) { window.__UA_STORE__ = mp.value.store; return true; }
      for (const k of ['return','child','sibling','alternate']) if (f[k]) stack.push(f[k]);
    }
  }
  return false;
}
```

Once installed on `window.__UA_STORE__`, read like so:

```js
const s = window.__UA_STORE__.getState();
// State top-level is either Immutable.Map (use s.get(key)) or plain object.
const toJS = v => (v && typeof v.toJS === 'function') ? v.toJS() : v;
const get = k => toJS(s.get ? s.get(k) : s[k]);
```

Top-level state bucket inventory (as of 2026-04-24 checkout page):

| Bucket | Relevance | What lives here |
|---|---|---|
| `commonShoppingCart` | **cart**, fares, taxes, trips | `.commonShoppingCartResponse.cslCart.cartData.DisplayCart` — full GrandTotal, DisplayPrices (with SubItems = tax lines), DisplayTrips (with per-leg flight info), IsNonRefundable, ProductCode |
| `profile` | **user profile lookups** | `.creditCards.byHash[hash]`, `.addresses.byHash[hash]`, `.phoneNumbers.byHash[hash]`, `.emailAddresses.byHash[hash]` — all keyed by an opaque `Key` string the SPA uses to cross-reference (e.g. card → address) |
| `app` | userProfile data | `.userProfile.data.Travelers[0]` — the logged-in MileagePlus traveler: FirstName, LastName, DOB, Gender, MileagePlusId, CustomerId, etc. |
| `seatMapBase` | this cart's committed traveler | `.trip.root.reservation.Travelers[0].Person` — same shape as userProfile BUT with `.Documents[]` (KTN lives in `Documents[*].KnownTravelerNumber`) |
| `cartReducer` | legacy cart state | Mostly empty / superseded by `commonShoppingCart` |
| `commonPaymentReducer` | payment operations | `.savedCardsDetails`, `.panNumberError`, `.contactlessPaymentEligibility`, etc. |
| `creditCardModel` | **new-card entry form** | Empty when a saved card is preselected. DO NOT use this to detect the current selection. |
| `registerTraveler` | traveler form state | `.registerTravelersResponse` |
| `reviewTripTraveler` | upsell + related | UpsellFlight, SavedMPTravelers, etc. |
| `forms` | all reducer-tracked forms | Some fields surface here; many ancillary forms (insurance, save-card) live in component-local state instead |

### Layer 2 — Persisted redux (IndexedDB via localforage)

Persisted across page loads. Transit-js-encoded Immutable state.

- IDB database: **`localforage`**
- Object store: **`keyvaluepairs`**
- Keys: **`reduxPersist:global`**, **`reduxPersist:storage`**
- Format: JSON string with transit-js tags (`~#iM` = Immutable.Map,
  `~#iL` = Immutable.List, `~#iOM` = Immutable.OrderedMap)
- Access:

```js
const db = await new Promise((ok, err) => {
  const r = indexedDB.open('localforage');
  r.onsuccess = () => ok(r.result);
  r.onerror   = () => err(r.error);
});
const blob = await new Promise(ok => {
  const tx = db.transaction('keyvaluepairs', 'readonly').objectStore('keyvaluepairs').get('reduxPersist:global');
  tx.onsuccess = () => ok(tx.result);
});
// `blob` is a string; parse with a transit-js reader or walk the tags manually.
```

Persisted state only carries search-form preferences and some
session hints; the current cart is **not** persisted there.

### Layer 3 — DOM (UI-only state not in Redux)

A handful of form fields live in React component local state
(`useState`/`setState`) rather than Redux. These never round-trip
to the store and must be read from the DOM. Each has a generic
selector that doesn't depend on the traveler's personal data:

| Field | DOM selector | Decoding |
|---|---|---|
| Selected saved card | `document.getElementById('savedCard').value` | Compound `<last4><typeCode>` — `"2005AX"` = AMEX ending 2005, `"9768MC"` = MasterCard ending 9768. Split `/^(\d{4})(\w+)$/`. The last4 joins back into `profile.creditCards.byHash`. |
| Travel-guard insurance choice | `document.querySelector('input[name="WASCInsuranceOfferOption"]:checked').value` | Suffix `_Decline` = declined, `_Accept` = purchased |
| Payment method tier | `document.querySelector('input[name="paymentMethod"]:checked').value` | `CC` = credit/debit, `TC` = travel credits, `PP` = PayPal, `AP` = Alipay+, `PZ` = Paze |
| Save-card-for-inflight toggle | checkbox with `name="Save your credit card for airport and inflight purchases."` (the full label is the `name`) | plain `.checked` |
| Short cart ref id | `document.body.innerText.match(/Cart ID:\s*(\d+)/)[1]` | The numeric user-visible ref. The long UUID is in URL/state. |

### The card → address join (this matters — don't use "primary")

**A saved card's billing address is NOT the user's primary
address.** Each card carries an `AddressKey` string that joins to
an entry in `profile.addresses.byHash`:

```js
const last4 = document.getElementById('savedCard').value.match(/^(\d{4})/)[1];
const card  = Object.values(state.profile.creditCards.byHash)
                   .find(c => c.AccountNumberLastFourDigits === last4);
const addr  = Object.values(state.profile.addresses.byHash)
                   .find(a => a.Key === card.AddressKey);
// addr.AddressLine1, addr.City, addr.StateCode, addr.PostalCode
```

Observed case: a user has 4 saved addresses, one flagged
`IsPrimary: true` that is NOT the billing address for the
currently-selected card. The checkout page shows the card's
AddressKey-linked address — the `IsPrimary` bit is unrelated to
booking billing.

### The traveler's KTN — pull from seatMapBase, not profile

`app.userProfile.data.Travelers[0]` has `KnownTravelerNumber` on
some profiles but it's sometimes only stamped into the reservation
when the cart is built. The reliable path for a cart-bound KTN:

```js
state.seatMapBase.trip.root.reservation.Travelers[0].Person.Documents
  .find(d => d.KnownTravelerNumber)?.KnownTravelerNumber
```

### Tax breakdown

`DisplayPrices[0].SubItems[]` where `item.Value === "Tax"` gives
the exact 8 (or N) line items the UI renders under "Taxes and
fees". `.Description` is already localized. **Don't parse the
rendered tax list from HTML** — the labels differ by locale.

### General rule

> **If it's shown on a United page, it's in `window.__UA_STORE__.getState()` or in the DOM's form elements. Walk the store first, fall back to DOM form values, never regex-scrape the rendered body.**

Codify as much of this as possible in Python skill tools
(`get_cart`, `get_contact_info`, future `get_checkout_state`) so
agents don't have to rediscover these paths.


## Checkout POST capture — post-mortem (session 4, 2026-04-24)

We attempted to pause-and-abort the real `/api/ShoppingCart/checkout`
POST via CDP `Fetch.enable` but **the capture armed too late and the
booking went through**. PNR: OSKNPT. $467.81 charged on AMEX ****2005.

### What the stub did

```python
send("Fetch.enable", {"patterns": [
    {"urlPattern": "*/api/ShoppingCart/checkout*", "requestStage": "Request"},
    {"urlPattern": "*/api/ShoppingCart/Purchase*", "requestStage": "Request"},
    {"urlPattern": "*/api/Payment/Submit*",       "requestStage": "Request"},
    {"urlPattern": "*checkout*",                  "requestStage": "Request"},   # ← loose
]})
# then click "Agree and purchase", drain events for 15s, abort first match.
```

### Why it missed

1. **URL pattern was too loose.** `*checkout*` matched the Akamai
   telemetry beacon `/public/<hash>/collect?...u=...checkout...` because
   the beacon URL-encodes the referer, and the checkout page URL
   contains the substring "checkout". So the first request Fetch
   flagged was the telemetry beacon that fires *after* the confirmation
   page has already loaded — i.e. after the booking POST already went
   through.
2. **Click-to-enable race.** `Fetch.enable` was sent, then
   `Input.dispatchMouseEvent` for the click, without explicitly
   awaiting the `Fetch.enable` response. The WebSocket may not have
   committed the interception config before the SPA fired its axios
   request.
3. **No response-side visibility.** `Fetch.enable` with
   `requestStage: "Request"` only catches outbound; if the real
   checkout POST somehow sneaks past the pattern, there's no sanity
   check that "hey, we just navigated to /confirmation/ without
   intercepting anything, something went wrong — bail!"

### Fix plan (next session)

- Narrow patterns to **exact paths**: `https://www.united.com/api/ShoppingCart/checkout`
  (no glob, no substring). Add `Purchase` and any sibling confirmed via
  live capture; drop `*checkout*`.
- Send `Fetch.enable` and wait for the result message ID **before**
  running the click. The existing `send()` helper already does this;
  the stub's fire-and-forget was a bug, not a limitation.
- Add a watchdog: monitor `Page.frameNavigated` too; if the frame
  navigates to `/confirmation/<cartId>` and we haven't paused a
  `/api/ShoppingCart/checkout` request yet, **we missed it** — log
  loudly so we know to redo the capture rather than silently thinking
  abort succeeded.
- Consider using `requestStage: "Response"` on top of Request, so even
  if we miss the Request-stage pause, we'll see the Response and know
  what the server returned.
- Better: do the capture with `Network.getResponseBody` after the fact.
  Enable `Network.responseReceived` listener; when we see the checkout
  URL's response, immediately call `Network.getResponseBody(requestId)`.
  This can't abort (it's observation-only), but it's race-free.

### What we learned about the flow (useful independent of the bug)

- The booking click fires axios `POST https://www.united.com/...` —
  exact path still unknown but the endpoint is one of:
  `/api/ShoppingCart/checkout`, `/api/ShoppingCart/Purchase`, or
  `/api/Payment/Submit`. Likely the first.
- Immediately after 200 from that POST, the SPA navigates to
  `/en/us/book-flight/confirmation/<cartId>?tqp=R` — no intermediate
  3DS challenge for saved cards, no modal, no confirmation.
- The Akamai telemetry beacon fires from the confirmation page with a
  17KB POST body to `/public/<hash>/collect` — interesting
  reconnaissance target but unrelated to booking.
- PNR is surfaced on the confirmation page. `list_trips` picks up the
  new reservation within seconds.

### Until the body is captured: confirm_booking stays read-only

The skill's `confirm_booking` tool still refuses to contact the
checkout endpoint — the exact JSON body is required to avoid sending
malformed money-moving requests. All other gates are real (HMAC blob,
confirm-amount string match, live re-read, card-on-file verification,
consent flags). The day we capture the body, wiring the final http.post
is a 10-line addition; everything else is already in place.
